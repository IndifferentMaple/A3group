								<p> <b> Demand From Employers: </b> <br> 
									Jobs in the IT industry are for the most part in shortage. 
									This is because as the world becomes more dependent on technology, employers are looking 
									for more workers with problem-solving and entrepreneurial skills as well as a combination 
									of creative and transferrable digital skills. ICT Security Specialist, Software Engineers 
									and Developer Programmer all report a shortage in the current labour market throughout all 
									of Australia. These jobs are also predicted to have strong growth in the future which means 
									the demand for qualified workers in these roles will increase. Project Administrators reported 
									not having a shortage throughout Australia as a whole, but in New South Wales (NSW) only. 
									This means the demand for Program or Project Administrators is greater in NSW than it is in 
									Australia as a whole. This occupation did however report strong future demand. This means that 
									employers will be on the lookout for professionals certified to perform 
									Project Administration soon. Currently, there is no shortage of ICT Business Analysts in 
									Australia. There are shortages within NSW and the Northern Territory (NT). This profession 
									is predicted to see moderate future demand. </p>

								<p> <b> General Skill Set: </b> <br> 
									<u> Reading comprehension </u> – Reading work-related information. <br> <br>
									<u> Critical thinking </u> – Thinking about the pros and cons of different ways to solve a problem. <br> <br> 
									<u> Quality control analysis </u> – Doing tests and checking products, services, or processes to make sure they are working properly. <br> <br> 
									Our group's general skill set covers reading comprehension, critical thinking, 
									and quality control assurance. These were chosen as they were the most common occurring 
									general skills between our selected ideal jobs. In terms of demand, these skills are sought 
									after for each of our ideal jobs.

									<p> For ICT security specialists, 57% of employers looked for employees with 
										critical thinking skills, 57% also looked for employees with reading comprehension 
										skills and 45% looked for workers with quality control analysis skills.
										<span class="image"><img src="images/IMG1.png" alt="" /></span>

									<p> <b> Required Skills not within our skill set: </b> <br>
									The three most desirable general skills not within our skill 
									set are Complex Problem Solving, Programming and Active Learning. 
									<span class="image"><img src="images/IMG6.png" alt="" /></span>
									</p> 

									<p> <b> IT Specific Skill Set: </b> <br> <br> 
									<b> SQL – </b> Allows for access and manipulation of databases, Stands for Structured Query Language. <br> <br> 

									<b> JavaScript – </b> A programming language that is used for website behaviour. <br> <br> 

									<b> C & C++ - </b> General purpose programming languages. <br> </p> 

									<p> <b> Opinion on my Ideal Job: </b> <br>
									After looking through the burning glass data I have not changed my opinion of my ideal job. I still believe that
									being an ICT Security Specialist is something that I wish to pursue. The national shortage of qualified workers 
									in this profession means that employers may be more willing to train me up to their standards even if I do not 
									meet their exact requirements. The strong demand growth in the future for IT Security Specialists has given 
									me more confidence in my ability to find employment in my selected field.

								created a platform in which users are able to sell their ideas. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “Okay. So I'm a, um, uh, my official title yeah, is, a senior manager 
								platform engineering. Um, but I a, my role is, uh, con-consultant. So I am, I'm a

								U.P explains that they work in professional services, which is a consulting company. 
								The company that he works for looks for organisations that need assistance with their 
								IT systems or help with their computer computing systems. An example of their work is if 
								all of a company's computer systems are in a data centre and they would also migrate it 
								into a cloud, U.P’s company is able to do it for them. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “So I work for a professional service, um, which, which 
								is basically a consulting company. So the consulting company, what we 
								usually do is we usually look for organizations that, um, need assistance 
								with their IT systems or with their computer computing systems.” <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “If organizations are going from on-premise systems or, you know, 
								if they have all of their computer systems in a data centre and they wanna move 
								that onto the cloud we can do that.” </p> 

								<p> <b> 3. What other kinds of work do you have to do? </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that the organisation that he works for since he works for professional services, 
								there is a lot of mentoring to do because it's a performance-driven organisation. 
								U.P makes sure that the people they work with have the correct skills and that the 
								teams they work with have the right culture. </p> 
								
								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “The organization I work for because it's a professional service, there's, 
								you know, there's a lot of things in terms of mentoring, and because it's sort of
								a performance-driven organization as well. There's, there's a lot of things like, 
								you know,  making sure that all the people that you work with have the correct skills,
								um, and then the teams that you work with have the right culture as well.” </p> 
								
								<p> <b> 4. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that his day-to-day role would be to interact with clients. 
								Understanding clients' requirements, and trying solutions for them. He also interacts 
								with people who are responsible for the delivery, and individuals who 
								interact with various stakeholders. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “My day-to-day role would be to, um, to sort of interacting with clients, so 
								understanding their requirements, try a solution for them. There are also people that I 
								interact with who are responsible for the delivery. So they do things like interact with 
								various stakeholders” </p> 

								<p> <b> 5. Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. </b> <br> 
								As U.P is the lead for a platform engineering team, he would interact with platform engineers, 
								security engineers and testers. The people he interacts with focus feature-based improvements, 
								an example would be mapping out tasks, working on it and eventually implementing that feature 
								onto the platform. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “So the team that I lead is a platform engineering team. 
								I would lead a team of you know, um, maybe about two or three platform engineers, 
								um, maybe two security engineers, um, a couple of testers, that's probably about it.” <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “What that means is we do things on feature-based improvements. 
								So we would, we would map out our tasks for the quarter and what we had to implement 
								within that quarter. </p> 

								<p> <b> 6. What about your interactions with clients or investors? </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that he would always have interactions with clients and instead of investors
								he would label them as stakeholders. Stakeholders are individuals who would have invested
								interest in the project or the systems they are developing. U.P's role is financial service-based,
								so an example of his interactions would be developing open banking solutions for a particular financial
								service or creating APIs for their existing system. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “So there's, there's always interactions with clients, not, 
								I don't think we would call them investors, we would call them sort of stakeholders, 
								so people who have invested interest in the project or in the systems that we're developing.” </p> 

								<p> <b> 7. What aspects of your work do you spend the most time on? Please tell us about these. </b> <br>
								U.P explains that he works mostly on designing and solving various components 
								or features of the platform he is working on. The team he leads is heavily cloud-based, 
								so they would have to solve different matters such as getting inside the cloud solution, 
								how to get customers inside securely and how to interact with systems that are outside of the 
								environment. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “It's probably designing and solutions for various components 
								or features of the platform. Um, so they could be things like you know, 
								because we're heavily cloud-based, how do we get inside the cloud solution? 
								How do we get customers inside securely? How do we interact with systems that 
								are outside of the environment?” </p> 

								<p> <b> 8. Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that the most challenging issue is setting customer expectations. 
								If a customer thinks that something needs to be done, he would determine if it is achievable
								or not. U.P would have to make sure that between the client, that's a balance between what 
								his company is able to do and what the client wants. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “The challenging bit is when trying to, uh, 
								I suppose, set customer expectations. So, if there's something that the customer
								thinks that they need or, um, would like to see that is probably not achievable.
								Trying to make sure that there's a balance between what we can do for the client and what
								the client wants. So those things are probably the biggest challenges.” </p> 

								</p> <b> 9. Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that 
								best captures the essence of the IT industry? </b> <br> 
								U.P worked on a project called Deloitte Assist that utilised Alexa devices. 
								The Alexa device would be used in nursing homes as well as hospitals, they would be next 
								to patients' beds as an alternative to the call button traditionally used. The traditional 
								call buttons could not determine how critical the situation was for the patient, but with the 
								use of Alexa, the patient has the ability to speak to the nurse indirectly that relates to their 
								need or situation. They managed to improve it by optimising the phrases said by the patients, if a 
								patient mentions a major issue such as chest pains, it would be given a higher priority. This project 
								shows what technology can do to better existing systems. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “Okay. So I worked on a project, um, uh, a while ago, um, 
								called Deloitte Assist. That project was to, um, use, um, Alexa devices. So, you know those,
								those Alexa devices, right? We put them into, um, nursing homes, sorry, not nursing, nursing
								homes as well as hospitals. So in patients' rooms and in next to patients' beds, the patients
								would interact with, um, the nurse, the nurses using the Alexa devices. What you would do is
								you would press a call button, right? Um, so that button says to the nurse that this patient 
								in bed needs you in bed, like 35 or whatever needs you. So the nurse would go off and you know,
								go off and see him. But the problem is that the nurses don't know how critical that is, right?
								So what we did was we created an Alexa skill to interact with the patients, and we would
								then, um, send out notifications to the nurses, and they, we would, they would actually
								have a board to say what the patient actually wanted. ” </p>

								<b> Bonus Questions: </b> 

								<p> <b> 1. What was the process of achieving the current position you're in? </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that he has been in the industry for some time. 
								When he first got into the industry it was good timing for him, he was in 
								the process of doing his computer science degree although he did not finish it. 
								The company that hired him did need to have some formal qualifications however U.P explains 
								that they were desperate for individuals with technical skills and were lenient enough to have 
								people not have the qualifications needed. U.P explains that at the time of being hired it was a 
								good time, as individuals who did not necessarily have the qualifications but were self-starters 
								and were technically capable were offered roles. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “When I got into the industry, it's sort of good timing I mean, 
								you did need to have some formal qualifications, but I think they were desperate for 
								people who had some sort of technical skills, um, that they would, uh, be lenient enough 
								for people not to have, you know, the qualifications that they need.” </p> 

								<p> <b> 2. As computers and online learning become accessible, do you think future employers
								will look for individuals with skills rather than qualifications and education? </b> <br> 
								U.P absolutely thinks that this will be the case in the future. 
								As a recruiter who mainly recruits from universities, he focuses on individuals who are self-starters, 
								and have passion and drive rather than individuals who have just formal education. Individuals who have 
								more technical skills have more potential since they are willing to roll off their sleeves and get dirty. </p>

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “I think, yeah, absolutely. I think especially that I do a lot of recruiting as well, 
								for my organization. We do recruit mainly from universities. I think that, 
								that there is a focus on people who are self-starters, who have passion and drive rather 
								than people who have just formal education.” </p> 

								<p> <b> 3. RELATING TO QUESTION 9 - What sort of outcome did you hope to come out of this project? </b> <br>
								U.P explains that their outcome was mainly to prove that a concept like this would work. 
								This project was a prototype since Alexa devices are more consumer-based, so 
								this project would not focus on using it in that way. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b>  “You know, the project was a prototype. 
								It was sort of just to prove that something like this could work because 
								those Alexa devices are sort of more consumer devices, there isn't that sort of
								 focus on using it in that way.” </p>

								<p> <b> 4. RELATING TO QUESTION 9 - What were the biggest challenges you faced when 
								developing this project? </b> <br> 
								U.P explains that the biggest challenge was the fact was not owned and developed by his company. 
								This was a challenge due to the fact the project was an Alexa skill, which can publicly be 
								available to everyone, however, U.P had to make it private to make it secure. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “The biggest problem was the device itself. 
								Since it wasn't owned by us, it was actually owned by Amazon. It's a consumer device, 
								all of the skills that you publish on an Alexa device, uh, are public. So, which means anyone 
								can get to it. So, um, we had to lock that down to make it private and to make it sort of secure.” </p>

								<p> <b> 5. RELATING TO QUESTION 9 - What professionals worked on this project? </b> <br> 
								The professionals that worked on this project consisted of developers, 
								architects, project managers, product leaders, cloud engineers and also a 
								registered nurse that helped oversee the project. </p> 

								<p> <b> <i> Supporting Quotes: </i> </b> <br> 
								<b> U.P: </b> “So we had some developers, obviously, you know, coders. 
								We had architects, people who would design the whole system from end to end. 
								We had cloud engineers, we had testers, and we actually had a nurse as well. 
								We had a lady who was a registered nurse that we worked with all the time. 
								Um, we would have project managers and product leads basically. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Cybersecurity</h2>
								<p> <b> Introduction </b> <br> 
									The invention of the Internet is probably one of the most important 
									inventions of the 21st Century. In only a few decades, the Internet has 
									completely re-invented the ways that we consume media and entertainment, search 
									for information, and communicate with others. With the most recent advent of the digital 
									smartphone, the capabilities to achieve, learn and distribute reach new heights. As more 
									business activities have shifted to a more computerlike approach with an increasing number 
									of computers being used for databases, records, and storing sensitive information, the 
									obligation to protect these computer systems from being hacked and breached has become 
									more apparent. <b> [1] </b> In recent years, ‘Cybersecurity’ or ‘Computer Security has been a widely 
									used term that has spread widely amongst practitioners and politicians alike. Cybersecurity 
									is the protection of computer systems and information from harm, theft, and unauthorized use. 
									<b> [2] </b> Computer security has become increasingly important since the 1980s when the proliferation 
									of personal computers compounded the concern. <b> [3] </b> Malicious computerphiles, also known as hackers, 
									are individuals with a technical computer, networking, or other skill to gain unauthorised access 
									to data. In more modern times, many hackers commit various forms of crimes ranging from identity 
									theft, – in which a hacker gains access to personal information to steal money or gain other 
									benefits, <b> [4] </b> – vandalism, - the destruction of data by a malicious computer virus better known as 
									malware – and invasion of privacy. – the act of illegally accessing protected personal data from a 
									large database -. The potential threat posed by cyberterrorism is an ongoing concern in the digital 
									era, however, cybersecurity aims to diminish such threats through the development of advanced 
									security measures and techniques which will help limit possible exposure to these vulnerabilities. </p> 

								<p> <b> What does it do? </b> <br> 
									Cybersecurity is best described as the art of protecting hardware, network, and 
									devices from unauthorized access with the practice of collecting techniques, technologies, 
									and processes to help ensure the confidentiality and availability of information from 
									cyber-attacks. <b> [5] [6] </b> Cybersecurity was created with the aim to combat internal or external 
									cyber threats and disruptions. According to IBM, in 2022 the average cost of an organizational 
									data breach is 4.35 million USD <b> [7] </b> A 12.7 per cent increase from their 2020 report which 
									reported an average cost of 3.86 million USD. These numbers are supported by the September 2022 
									Optus data breach in which an anonymous cyberattack led to the details of 11 million customers 
									being accessed, alongside 10 thousand customers’ details being leaked on the clear web. <b> [8] </b>
									If better measures had been implemented this breach could have been prevented. If a company 
									the size of Optus can be a victim of a cyber-attack it means that regular consumers and 
									individuals can also be victims as well, even with a less prominent attack. 
									A new state-of-the-art breakthrough within cybersecurity is the use of artificial 
									intelligence having the capability to analyze and prevent cyber-attacks. As cyberattacks 
									have grown exponentially in complexity and magnitude, more security measures have been 
									researched and tested to find the next big break in cybersecurity. In response to the 
									emergence of these unprecedented challenges, the topic of Artificial Intelligence-based 
									tools has become a driving factor in helping security operations analysts stay ahead of 
									internal and external threats. <b> [9] </b> Artificial Intelligence refers to the “technologies that 
									can understand, learn and act based on acquired and derived information.” <b> [10] </b> AI is ideally 
									suited to solve some of the most complex and difficult issues, and cybersecurity without a 
									doubt falls within that class. <br> 
									In the case of using Artificial Intelligence in cybersecurity in present times, there 
									are many main benefits that can help organizations prevent cyberattacks. AI can be used 
									to detect cyber-attacks and malicious activities before it enters their system, an example
									is a verification system captcha that many organizations have implemented. Using AI for 
									cybersecurity enables organizations to understand and reuse threat patterns to predict and 
									identify new threats. Since AI continuously learns, it expands its knowledge to understand 
									cybersecurity threats by consuming billions of data artifacts. In doing so, it also provides
									well-curated risk analysis, reducing the time security analysts take to make critical 
									decisions. <b> [11] </b> According to a study conducted by Capgemini Research Institute, they 
									surveyed 850 senior executives in IT Information Security, cybersecurity, and IT 
									Operations across 10 different countries and close to two-thirds of cybersecurity 
									executives say that AI lowers the cost to detect and respond to breaches. <b> [12] </b> As networks 
									become larger and data becomes more complex, AI provides better solutions to growing needs. 
									Simply put, humans cannot handle the growing complexity of cyber threats, and sooner or 
									later, the use of AI becomes inevitable. <br> 
									The possibilities of using Artificial Intelligence can be endless, it 
									will most likely move from a detective approach to a more autonomous 
									defence formula in the years to come. AI is revolutionising the way 
									cybersecurity is being designed as it is slowly being integrated into the field. 
									In the span of three more years, drastic developments can be made relating to AI in the 
									cybersecurity field. A possibility of a system that verifies a threat within a network can 
									be ideal. Protecting networks is crucial for organizations, managing network security includes 
									identifying legitimate and illegitimate connection requests, which can be a time-consuming 
									task for cybersecurity officials. AI could assist the system to identify threats by 
									automatically identifying verification documents that consist of breaches and prevent 
									organizations from the leakage of sensitive information. <b> [13] </b> Alongside a network detection 
									system, an AI-supported email monitoring system can be employed to detect any suspicious 
									activity or content. In some cases, NLP (Natural Language Processing) can be used to identify 
									different styles of writing and phrases to prevent the threat of phishing. An additional 
									possibility can be the development of better and more complex protection mechanisms in 
									real-time, granted that this may take years of research, development and testing however 
									it is not too farfetched.  AI helps lower costs and improve response time and response to 
									breaches regardless of the forms, modalities, and specific characteristics in which it is used.  
									The use of machine learning or sophisticated AI algorithms plays a key role in this development. 
									<b> [14] </b> Machine learning uses statistical techniques that allow computer systems to learn using data 
									rather than being hard-programmed. While AI is not a quick solution for all cybersecurity matters, they 
									are incredibly useful for rapidly automating the decision-making process and deducing patterns ranging 
									from incomplete or modified pieces of data. These algorithms work by consuming real-world data, such as 
									existing security threats, as well as new research gathered by researchers worldwide. <b> [15] </b> While AI and 
									machine learning are not risk-free, it is expected that their use will improve over time. The usage of 
									machine learning and algorithms has already become a piece of technology that developers use to create 
									the possibility of cybersecurity and AI going hand in hand. </p> 
										
								<p> <b> What is the likely impact? </b> <br>
									Artificial Intelligence will certainly create a breakthrough within the cybersecurity space. 
									Cybersecurity professionals will inevitably have to shift their focus onto using AI and machine 
									learning to create the most secure online environment not only from a business standpoint but 
									from a more global perspective. Currently, AI and machine learning have already proven to 
									have a beneficial impact on the ever-changing landscape, helping to automate threat detection, 
									and providing valuable analytics that assists experts to understand cybercrime and respond 
									more efficiently and effectively than the software-driven or manual techniques used today.
									To understand the potential impact that AI can bring, in 2022 IBM surveyed 1000 executives with 
									overall responsibility for their organization’s IT and Operational Technology sectors, and more than 64% of respondents 
									have implemented AI for security capabilities and 29% are evaluating implantation, leaving only 7% of respondents 
									not considering the use of AI <b> [16] </b> The percentage will eventually grow as more testing and research is completed nonetheless 
									his proves that Artificial Intelligence is gaining traction and eventually AI will most definitely be a compulsory tool in the cybersecurity industry. 
									As humans get more overwhelmed with the mass quantities of attacks the benefits of AI 
									outweigh the risks of manual operation with humans. An average company must deal with 
									threats daily and must take a multitude of steps to protect the vulnerabilities. The 
									use of AI when applied to cybersecurity will make it difficult for attacks to occur due 
									to the fact that AI has the ability to learn and adapt without explicit instructions. As
									more development of the tool is made, there will be no surprise if it will be consumerized.
									Companies that see AI as being profitable will no doubt try to make AI available to 
									individuals who are looking for an alternative method to protect themselves.
									The use of AI will most likely affect every single person with a device, online connection 
									or generally, anyone that uses a form of technology. Individuals in this digitalized world 
									can be rest assured that with the use of AI, the threat of an attack or data breach be much 
									slimmer than it was before. Different systems and databases will be much more secure as more 
									experts get familiar with the technology, and more countermeasures will be put in place to protect 
									confidential information. However, with the use of AI being able to prevent threats posed by cyber
									terrorists, it will not mean that criminals will not also use AI to their advantage, it is just 
									a matter of who can develop a better algorithm that can overcome the other.
									While AI’s feature of automation is necessary, its current functionality will 
									not completely replace and erase the roles of cybersecurity experts. The use of
									AI has not been developed thoroughly enough to a point where it can be fully autonomous 
									without the need for human supervision so the likelihood of replacing professionals in the 
									industry does not seem to be a possibility any time soon. Moreover, AI used in cybersecurity 
									can create more openings for jobs as the requirement to use AI grows. Consultants and recruiters 
									have a substantial demand for AI skills across the industry and with the implementation of AI in 
									cybersecurity the demand for developers and engineers will increase. In addition to creating
									openings, AI will also replace and make current techniques and methods redundant. As developers
									find new and more efficient ways to eliminate threats, the traditional ways of cybersecurity
									will be replaced. </p> 
 
								<p> <b> How will this affect you? </b> <br>
									The development and implementation of AI in cybersecurity will affect us all. 
									In the modern world, breaches of privacy are beginning to become a common occurrence, 
									it can be unpredictable and can have catastrophic consequences. In our day-to-day life, 
									we use some form of technology. Most individuals in Australia use a computerized system 
									in their life, we use it to exchange information, communicate and store private information. 
									Even items like door locks, furniture and security features are now technology based. If a 
									cyber-attack on one of those sectors happens, we could be forced to deal with the consequences. 
									The use of AI could help prevent all those consequences from happening, it will provide comfort 
									for us as we can be assured that our information is secured and encrypted without any worry. 
									AI will change the daunting feeling of placing sensitive information in the wrong hands. 
									To elaborate, AI will put a bigger barricade towards the protection of our data, as it is 
									everchanging and evolving. Our family and friends will also be directly affected when AI is 
									applied to cybersecurity. As stated before, most individuals use a computer-based system to 
									communicate, bank and do things in their everyday routine. This new technology will help protect 
									our loved ones from having to deal with the consequences of a cyber-attack. AI improves the overall 
									structure of cybersecurity, from what was once manually operated will slowly become autonomous. 
									Our society will change, be in better hands and the world will have a more secure online space. </p> 

								<p> <b> Conclusion </b> <br> 
									The introduction of cybersecurity has revolutionised the way 
									that we protect confidential information. What was once a new 
									form of technology designed to protect us online from criminal or 
									unauthorized use is now a necessity in the modern world. The breakthrough 
									of AI and machine learning in cybersecurity will change the industry. The benefits 
									of being able to detect threats faster than a regular human, better response time 
									towards an attack and being able to learn, analyze and provide crucial data to assist 
									experts without any instructions will forever change the way cybersecurity works. </p>

								<h3 class="major">Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h3>
								<p> <b> Introduction </b> <br> 
									The concept of currency has been around as early as 1200 BCE. 
									The earliest forms of currency were objects created by nature, an 
									example would be a cowrie shell, the shell of a mollusc that was widely 
									available in the shallow waters of the Pacific and Indian Oceans. 
									As the use of the cowrie shell was popularized and used by different societies 
									throughout parts of Africa and Asia, the first Bronze and Copper imitations were 
									manufactured by China around the year 1000 BCE, this could be considered the earliest 
									form of the metal coin. Outside of China the first-rounded coins were developed from 
									lumps of silver and were stamped with various gods and emperors to mark their authenticity. 
									These coins first appeared in the Kingdom of Lydia (modern-day Turkey) and were quickly 
									replicated and used by the surrounding Greek, Persian, Macedonian and Roman Empires. 
									<b> [17] </b> As different forms of currency were used throughout history it was not until the 
									first paper currency was manufactured in China in the 10th Century. The innovation was not 
									money in its traditional use; however, it was used as a form of agreement – a promise to pay 
									in specific amounts of gold and silver – which later was a key in the development of banks. 
									By the 18th and 19th Centuries the use of paper money spread across the globe, the first universal 
									credit card was introduced in 1950 and then came along credit cards with a magnetic strip 
									that was used to contain account information. By the 1990s, credit cards began to have chips 
									embedded inside to encrypt their information, leading to better security. Eventually, the company 
									American Express – the originator of the plastic credit card – allowed consumers to carry a 
									balance, and others began to follow shortly after <b> [18] </b> The introduction of first digital 
									currency was created in 2009 by an anonymous computer programmer or group of programmers 
									known as Satoshi Nakamoto. Very little is known about the identity/identities of 
									Nakamoto, however, alongside the creation of the first digital currency, he also 
									created a digital ledger system called Blockchain. Blockchain was adopted to solve 
									an issue within cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency could be duplicated, this was known as 
									“double spending”. Nakamoto solved the issue by creating a blockchain, and along with it 
									had the ability to issue currency, record transactions and keep an anonymous traceable 
									record across a decentralized peer-to-peer network. <b> [19] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What does it do? </b> <br>
									A blockchain is a form of open distributed ledger technology that can 
									record transactions made between two parties. Blockchain holds several 
									unique attributes, the many attributes it holds are decentralization, permanency, 
									transparency, and security. Amazon Web Service (AWS) states, in blockchain its 
									decentralization refers to “the transfer of control and decision making from a 
									centralized entity to a distributed network” <b> [20] </b> To put it in short, blockchain 
									is not governed by any individual, group, or government. Blockchain has an immutable 
									database, which means that you are not able to modify any data that is already recorded 
									inside a blockchain meaning that it is also protected from any cyber-attacks. The transparency 
									of blockchain refers to the fact that it is fully auditable and entirely traceable. Blockchain 
									holds a completely accurate record of transactions which allows it to be easily maintained. <b> [21] </b> <br> <br> 
									Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that enables parties to make direct 
									payments to one another using a distributed ledger technology called blockchain 
									that enables a secure transaction. Cryptocurrencies are generated through a process 
									called mining, a process that involves computational power solving a complicated mathematical 
									problem to generate one coin. Cryptocurrencies have no real intrinsic value, meaning they are 
									worth what others are willing to pay for them on the market. Similarly to blockchain technology, 
									cryptocurrencies are decentralized, they are not overseen by any higher authority. Centralized 
									cryptocurrency exchanges are more susceptible to data breaches and cyber-attack than decentralized 
									exchanges. There are many different types of cryptocurrencies, some of the most notable are Bitcoin, 
									Ethereum and Tether, each holding its own respective market price and market cap <b> [22] </b> The purpose 
									of cryptocurrency is to be used as an alternative payment method. In addition, cryptocurrency can 
									also be used as an asset to store wealth, a hedge against inflation and a method of buying real estate. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </b> <br> 
									The state-of-the-art development relating to blockchain and cryptocurrency 
									is the concept of Web 3.0. Web 1.0 is the first iteration of the world wide web, 
									created by British scientist Tim Berners-Lee, it lasted from 1989 to roughly 2005. 
									Web 1.0 is referred to as the “read-only” web, only static information that was published 
									could be searched and read, and there was very little way for user interactions and 
									user-generated content. Examples of Web 1.0 are basic HTML Pages, forums, and email. <b> [23] </b> 
									Web 2.0 is the second iteration of the world wide web, which is described as the 
									current state of the Internet. Web 2.0 are communal web pages that allow visitors to 
									modify their information. Web 2.0 turned static web pages into dynamic or user-generated 
									content, the best examples of Web 2.0 are social media sites such as Facebook and Myspace, 
									video sharing sites such as YouTube and Vimeo and other hosted web services such as Google 
									Maps <b> [24] </b> Web 3.0 is the third iteration of the world wide web; Web 3.0 uses 
									decentralization as its foundation and is built on an open, decentralized blockchain 
									network. The reason Web 3.0 is decentralized is to prevent a few companies from controlling 
									the internet. Web 3.0 is generally a decentralized web where apps, online services and 
									finance no longer need authority. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </b> <br> 
									As of 2022, Web 3.0 is still currently in development, however, is seeing
									rapid growth in development due to significant funding from venture capitalists.
									Many challenges about Web 3.0 have been raised recently, due to the current circumstances,
									not everyone is familiar with the concept of blockchain and a decentralized web. Centralized
									platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have already been embedded in society, 
									meaning most users will unlikely switch currently. Another issue raised is the compatibility 
									of Web 3.0 and Web 2.0, the Internet has billions of pages that contain billions of pieces of 
									data, and a system that will be able to read and understand the functionality of the data will 
									have to be developed thoroughly. <b> [25] </b> </p>

								<p> <b> What technological or other developments make this possible? </b> <br> 
									Web 3.0 will be released in the near future and unlike its predecessors, 
									Web 3.0 will have a variety of new functions and features that will make it unique. 
									Since it is built upon blockchain and crypto-economic systems, it will not only be a way to
									manage data, but also a way to redistribute ownership. The feature of decentralization will 
									allow new concepts of decentralized applications to be available, decentralized finances, games, 
									and digital infrastructure will all be new additions to the world wide web <b> [26] </b> In Web 3.0, 
									computer systems will be able to understand and process information similarly to humans, with the 
									use of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning, Web 3.0 will use data and algorithms to imitate
									how humans learn and think. The goal of using AI is for computers to enable faster and more relevant 
									results thus developing greater intelligence and nurturing consumer satisfaction. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the likely impact? </b> <br>
									As stated beforehand AI, machine learning and blockchain 
									will all be key technologies in making Web 3.0 possible. 
									AI and Machine Learning are the defining features of Web 3.0. with the 
									ability to learn and provide crucial analysis and data, it will create more 
									customized and better generally purposed algorithms. Blockchain’s key feature 
									is its decentralized and transparent nature. As the goal of building an AI-driven, 
									decentralized web, with the use of blockchain immutable logs and identity-based 
									authentication will almost guarantee user anonymity, it will pave the way for how 
									individuals and organizations set new rules and exchange assets. In Web 3.0, blockchains
									will be a replacement in how users access content, store and manage data, rather than the 
									traditional centralized databases and applications. <b> [27] [28] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the potential impact of this development? </b> <br> 
									Web 3.0 will be a transparent network where individuals 
									are able to interact without the fear of security and privacy. 
									Web 3.0 will have a high processing capacity due to its trust and high adaptability. 
									The use of AI Web 3.0 offers a more personalized browsing experience. An AI-generated 
									algorithm will cause websites to be automatically adapted to our device, evaluate data more 
									quickly and offer it to users more swiftly. Eventually, as the public using Web 2.0 get familiar 
									with Web 3.0, they will soon turn to it the as can see and reap the benefits. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to change? </b> <br> 
									The possibilities of Web 3.0 are endless, new ideas and 
									suggestions get brought up and discussed daily. An example of 
									the potential that Web 3.0 has, is the ability to provide greater user 
									utility. If you are making plans for a vacation and are on a budget, you 
									would have to search the world wide web comparing prices and expenses. With the 
									use of the Web 3.0 algorithm and AI-powered network, It will be able to collect all 
									this information and generate the correct recommendations suited to your needs. Furthermore, 
									users can have the potential to create content while owning, controlling, and monetizing them 
									with the use of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies, these are called NFTs. NFTS stand 
									for “Non-Fungible Tokens”. NFTs are virtual assets, they can be classified as art, 
									collectibles, and even virtual games. NFTs enable ownership of unique assets that 
									are authenticated and traceable through the blockchain, in addition, NFTs can be exchanged 
									for goods and services in the real world and online through virtual markets. <b> [29] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> Which people will be most affected and how?	</b> <br>
									Whether we like it or not, the launch of Web 3.0 will affect everyone. 
									The launch of Web 3.0 will have a variety of different concepts demands and 
									changes that will affect every single person that uses technology, similarly to 
									how the Internet has revolutionized the world. The way we control our privacy, 
									manage our data, and view material will all be decentralized, every person that 
									uses Web 3.0 will be ensured that their data, assets, and privacy belongs to them only. </p> 

								<p> <b> Will this create, replace, or make any current jobs or technologies redundant? </b> <br>
									Web 3.0 will most likely create demand for jobs relating to Web 3.0 development. 
									The role of standard programmers will evolve from having to create and deploy 
									applications that rely on a server and more so evolve to creating applications 
									that are designed to run on the blockchain and related decentralized peer-to-peer
									networks. Demand for AI developers will rise too, as Web 3.0 core functionality is 
									the use of AI and machine learning to power its algorithms, an increase of AI developers 
									seem to be a likely outcome from the launch of Web 3.0 <b> [30] </b> Web 3.0 will also make old 
									technologies redundant. Recommendations from centralized applications that collect your data 
									will be irrelevant. The breach of privacy that companies can collect data without your 
									permission to boost ads and recommendations will no longer happen. </p> 

								<p> <b> How will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									Web 3.0 will be a new chapter of technology for me. 
									There will most likely be a learning curve, but I am confident 
									that I’ll be able to quickly adapt and use it to its potential. </p> 

								<p> <b> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									Web 3.0 will be an application that I would most likely use daily, 
									as an avid user of Web 2.0, the optimisations that Web 3.0 will bring 
									will also have the possibility to affect me in real life. The use of blockchains 
									intrigues me, the idea of being able to own, monetize and distribute all at once 
									are all separate factors that make Web 3.0 interesting. The AI algorithm will most 
									likely have a positive effect on my mental health, my interests and demands will all 
									be recommended to me while using Web 3.0. The negative materials will all be blocked 
									and prevented from my view with the Algorithm. </p> 

								<p> <b> What will be different for you? </b> <br>
									Web 3.0 will change the ways I manage and control my data and privacy, 
									consume media and content, and do my daily necessitates. I can be rest assured 
									knowing that I am safe from any invasion of privacy and cyber attacks that usually 
									are a daily occurrence within a centralized network. I will most likely pursue a 
									passion in Web 3.0 development as there are countless ideas and 
									concepts that need to be brought to life. </p> 

								<p> <b> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </b> <br> 
									My loved ones will also be affected as well, 
									the ways they are able to use the blockchain to 
									have the potential to build a career, store their 
									wealth and be protected from any discrepancies will all 
									be positive effects of Web 3.0. </p>

								<p> <b> Conclusion </b> <br> 
									Web 3.0 will be the next iteration of the world 
									wide web that we all love and use today. The rapid 
									development funded by the biggest venture capitalists 
									in the world will revolutionise the internet in the same 
									way as its creation. The use of cryptocurrencies, blockchain 
									and AI will all be unique factors that differentiate it from 
									anything we have seen before. Instead of being a part of a 
									centralised network where negative aspects and outcomes occur 
									daily, the decentralised network of Web 3.0 will cause all users 
									to be able to safely manage their data and privacy without the 
									fear of attacks, alongside the option to be able to own, monetize 
									and distribute their own assets. The launch of Web 3.0 will be a 
									revolutionary step for technology, it will just 
									be a matter of time. </p>

								<h2 class="major">Robots</h2>
								<p> <b> What does it do? </b> <br> 
									A robot is an autonomous machine designed to do a certain activity or set of tasks. 
									This means that once it has been programmed to perform a task, it can execute it autonomously. 
									There are numerous sorts of robots, but industrial robots, service robots, and domestic robots 
									are among the most common. In production and assembly lines, industrial robots are often used 
									to do repetitive operations, such as welding or painting. Vacuum cleaners and lawnmowers are 
									examples of service robots that are designed to aid people. Domestic robots are gaining 
									popularity since they are designed to handle activities around the house, such as cleaning 
									and providing security. Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that integrates engineering, 
									computer science, and physics to create robots. The study of robotics 
									enables the development of robots that are more efficient and effective at 
									performing their intended jobs. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </b> <br> 
									The state of the art for new robot technology is rapidly evolving. 
									There are new advances in robotics technology being made every day, 
									and the field is growing rapidly. The applications for new robot technology 
									are vast and varied, and the potential for new robots to impact our lives is immense. 
									Some of the most exciting new developments in robot technology include: <br> <br> 

									<b> Soft Robotics: </b> <br> 
									This new field of robotics is focused on creating robots made from soft, flexible materials. 
									This allows robots to more easily interact with humans and the world around them. <br> <br> 

									<b> Swarm Robotics: </b> <br> 
									This new technology involves robots working together in large groups, often referred
									to as swarms. Swarm robotics has many potential applications, 
									including search and rescue, military operations, and environmental monitoring. <br> <br> 

									<b> 3D Printing </b> <br> 
									3D printing is revolutionizing manufacturing, and it is also starting to be used
									to create robots. This new technology allows for robots to be made quickly 
									and easily, and it opens up a whole new world of possibilities for robot design. <br> <br> 

									<b> Biomimetics: </b> <br> 
									This new field of robotics is focused on creating robots that mimic the form
									 and function of living organisms. This allows for robots to be designed for a
									  wide variety of tasks, including healthcare, and environmental cleanup. </p> 

								<p> <b> What can be done now? </b> <br> 
									There are a few different approaches that can be taken in order to operate effectively
									with robots at this time. To start, it is feasible to write programs that will instruct
									the robot on how to complete a variety of different jobs. In addition, it is feasible
									to develop software that would serve as an interface between humans and robots, making
									it possible for humans to exercise direct control over the robot. Finally, it is
									conceivable to develop algorithms that will make it possible for the robot to gain
									knowledge from the experiences it has had and improve its ability to carry out tasks
									as more time passes.
									Each of these approaches calls for a specific degree of investment in terms of 
									both time and resources; nonetheless, it is possible to put each of them into action 
									in order to get started working with robots right away. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </b> <br>
									Some people anticipate that significant leaps will be made in the field of robotics technology within the next three years. 
									The following are some of the possible occurrences that could take place during that time frame:
									expanded use of robots in manufacturing and other types of industrial environments. 
									Use of robots in the supply chain, particularly in sectors such as logistics, on a much larger scale. 
									The development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms for artificial intelligence will enable robots 
									to interact with humans and their environments in more natural ways.
									An increase in the usage of 3D printing technology in the production of robots will result in the robots 
									becoming more reasonably priced and easily accessible.
									The development of new uses for robots in fields such as medicine and farming is now becoming more common. </p> 

								<p> <b> What technological or other developments make this possible? </b> <br>
									As technology progresses, robots become more popular and sophisticated. 
									There are numerous types of robots, ranging from industrial robots to personal service 
									robots. This technology is growing more popular and advanced since it provides numerous 
									advantages. One of the primary advantages of robots is that they may aid in the 
									improvement of efficiency and productivity in a range of contexts. Robots, for example, can 
									be employed to automate repetitive operations in manufacturing. This can help to increase 
									product quality while also shortening production times. Furthermore, robots can be utilized 
									in healthcare to aid in surgery or to provide personal care to patients. Another advantage of 
									robots is that they can provide increased security. Robots, for example, can be deployed in 
									dangerous areas such as nuclear power plants. They can also be employed in rescue efforts, such 
									as those conducted following a natural disaster. Robots are becoming increasingly popular due 
									to the numerous benefits they provide. Robots are becoming more advanced and capable of performing 
									a wide range of tasks as technology develops. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the likely impact? </b> <br> 
									The influence that robots have had and will continue to have on civilization 
									is both extensive and nuanced. In general, the applications that robots are used 
									for can either result in significant negative effects or significant positive effects.
									Robots could result in the loss of jobs in the future. It is possible that humans will become obsolete in the workforce 
									as robots become more competent of performing tasks traditionally performed by humans. Those who are in a position to own 
									and maintain robots will have a major advantage over those who are not, which could result in widespread unemployment and income disparity.
									Robots may also have the effect of increasing both productivity and efficiency in the workplace. 
									Robots can complete tasks more quickly, correctly, and reliably than humans can, and they 
									don't get weary. Those that have access to robots may benefit from higher economic growth 
									as well as an improvement in their level of living as a result of this. 
									The last possible effect that robots could have is on people's social lives. 
									It's possible that individuals will become less sociable and more solitary as they 
									connect with robots rather than other humans in growing numbers. This may have a detrimental 
									effect on both mental health and the cohesiveness of the community. 
									In general, it is difficult to predict how robots will affect society. 
									Depending on how they are put to use, they either have the capacity to inflict significant 
									harm or bring about significant good. It is essential to keep an eye on how they 
									are being developed and put to use in order to guarantee that they will have a positive 
									effect on society. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the potential impact of this development? </b> <br> 
									This new advancement may have a number of repercussions, one of which is that it may result 
									in robots being utilized for a greater variety of jobs and becoming more prevalent in society. 
									People's lives may be made simpler as a result, as they would not have to carry out certain 
									responsibilities themselves. It may also result in the loss of jobs due to the fact that robots 
									may be able to replace people in certain functions.
									This new development can be seen as a positive by some individuals because it might result in 
									increased productivity and a decreased demand for human work. Some people might have a negative 
									opinion of it since it might result in widespread unemployment and a further reduction in the 
									significance of human labour. </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to change? </b> <br> 
									In the future, robots are likely to become more widespread and more sophisticated. 
									They may be used more extensively in manufacturing, healthcare, and other industries. 
									They may also be used more for personal tasks, such as cleaning, cooking, and providing 
									companionship. As robots become more advanced, they are likely to become more expensive. 
									In addition to becoming more widespread and more sophisticated, robots are also likely to 
									become more socially accepted. As they become more commonplace, people are likely to become 
									more comfortable interacting with them. This could lead to robots becoming more involved in 
									our everyday lives. </p> 

								<p> <b> Which people will be most affected and how? </b> <br> 
									The people who will be most affected by robots are those who are replaced by them in
									the workforce. As robots become increasingly sophisticated and capable, 
									they will take on an ever-increasing number of tasks and jobs that humans currently 
									perform. This will result in large numbers of people becoming unemployed and potentially 
									unemployable. This will have a profound and negative impact on their lives, as well as on 
									the economy as a whole. Robots in businesses have been a sensitive issue in recent years. 
									Others believe robots will create new jobs. Robots will affect the future of labour, but 
									it's hard to say how. Robots' impact on jobs depends on numerous aspects. One is robot-replaceable 
									jobs. Repetitive or low-interaction jobs are more likely to be automated than creative or 
									high-interaction jobs. Deployment speed is another consideration. Slow robot deployment 
									gives workers time to adapt and gain new skills. If robots are implemented swiftly, workers 
									may not have time to adjust, leading to mass unemployment.
									Robots will change the future of work. This is hard to forecast. 
									The outcome will depend on how robots are used. </p> 
									
								<p> <b> Will this create, replace or make redundant any jobs and technologies? </b> <br> 
									The implementations of robots will help replace and create jobs. The use of robots that 
									are used in a labour environment will replace the need for humans, as robots have the 
									ability to handle more heavier objects without any fatigue and stress. However with the 
									implementations of robots, it will create a higher demand in the IT industry. As more robots 
									are being implemented the need for different programmers, developers and artificial intelligence 
									will have a substantial increase. </p> 

								<p> <b> How will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									It is highly likely that the use of robots in a variety of contexts will have a significant 
									effect, not only on people but also on society as a whole. In the not-too-distant future, 
									humans will gradually be replaced by robots in a variety of jobs that are currently carried 
									out by other people. Because of this, a great number of workers will be forced out of their 
									jobs, and the composition of the workforce will undergo significant transformations. The 
									manufacturing industry, which already makes substantial use of robots, is likely to be 
									particularly hard hit by the employment implications of the rise of artificial intelligence 
									(AI)-powered machines. Additionally, there is a good chance that there will be a rise in the 
									usage of robots in the service industry. This is due to the fact that robots are being 
									increasingly utilized to carry out jobs such as cleaning, cooking, and providing care to the 
									old and the infirm. The introduction of robots into the workforce is also anticipated to have 
									a substantial impact on the characteristics of work. It is anticipated that the abilities 
									necessary to work with robots will become more significant in the future as robots become 
									increasingly used to accomplish tasks that are currently carried out by humans. In addition, the 
									usage of robots is expected to alter the fundamental characteristics of many different types of 
									jobs, in addition to the manner in which work is structured. The introduction of robots into 
									society is also expected to have a number of additional effects, both on people and on 
									society as a whole. For example, the usage of robots is likely to lead to the development 
									of new kinds of leisure and entertainment, in addition to changes in other aspects of society. In 
									the manner in which individuals engage in conversation with one another, the usage of robots 
									is expected to have repercussions not just for the functioning of the economy but also for the 
									distribution of wealth and income, this is due to the fact that robots can perform tasks that 
									humans cannot. </p> 

								<p> <b> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									In your daily life, a robot may affect you in many ways. For instance, a robot may be your 
									personal assistant, helping you with tasks such as cooking, cleaning, and grocery shopping. 
									Additionally, robots may be used in manufacturing and other industries, meaning that your job 
									may be replaced by a robot in the future. However, robots may also have a positive impact on 
									your life, providing you with companionship and assistance when needed. </p> 

								<p> <b> What will be different for you? </b> <br> 
									I believe that the biggest difference for me would be the increased level of independence I would have. 
									With a robot to help me with things around the house, I would be able to take care of myself more easily 
									and wouldn't need to rely on others as much. Additionally, I think it would be interesting to see how my 
									relationship with a robot would change over time. </p> 

								<p> <b> How might this affect members of your family or your friends? </b> <br> 
									If you had a robot in your family, it would be interesting to see how your other family members and friends would react. 
									Some might be scared of it or think it was weird, while others would be fascinated and want to learn more about it. 
									It would be fun to have a robot around to help with things or just to talk to, but it would also be interesting to see 
									how people would react to having a robot in the family. </p>

							<article id="AutonomousVehicles">
								<h2 class="major">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
								<p> <b> What does it do? </b> <br> 
									Autonomous vehicles are vehicles with the capability of driving themselves from a 
									starting point to a predetermined destination with the ability to navigate many types 
									of roadways and environments without the need for human assistance or interference. 
									In theory, an autonomous vehicle can be only termed autonomous, when all the dynamic 
									tasks can be performed by the automated “Autopilot” system of the vehicle. The vehicle’s 
									architecture varies among companies and research centres, and different opinions on being 
									able to optimize the architecture to its potential are being discussed and implemented daily. 
									There are four distinct components that are found in any design of the vehicle: the action 
									system, sensing system, client system and the human-machine interface. The main objective of 
									autonomous vehicles is to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities that occur on the road. <b> [1] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the state of the art of this new technology? </b> <br> 
									The latest trend and development in the topic of Autonomous vehicles is the shift from 
									a taxi-based system to automated trucks and delivery vehicles. The COVID-19 Pandemic has 
									damaged the progress of being able to profit from ridesharing in the automated vehicle 
									industry, the sharp decrease in the demand for ride-sharing services, in general, is due to 
									the previous social distancing requirements and prioritising of road space favoured to 
									pedestrians and cyclists. The difficulties in commercializing automated mobility services 
									have caused many companies to shift their focus and resources towards delivery services and 
									automated trucks. Many setbacks and delays caused investors and leaders to search for other 
									profitable revenues and ideas, leading them to a more practical and feasible approach to the 
									development of delivery vehicles. <b> [2] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What can be done now? </b> <br> 
									The use of automated delivery trucks and vehicles has already been tested throughout many 
									countries and roads. The testing of automated delivery vehicles has already tested both light 
									and heavy-duty segments. Several companies are currently working on developing automation for 
									long-haul trucking, which is designed as a transfer system. This concept involves automated 
									trucks completing the more open highway routes while human drivers drive and maneuver 
									throughout the complex suburban areas in both the starting point and end points of the 
									journey. Many companies in various industries have already tested the use of autonomous delivery 
									vehicles, these companies include American-based postal service FedEx, American retail powerhouse 
									Walmart, and even Swedish furnishing retailer Ikea. The development of automated delivery 
									vehicles will soon rapidly evolve the traditional methods of transporting goods. <b> [3] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to be able to be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? </b> <br> 
									Within the next couple of years, the previous concept mentioned of a transfer system between 
									automated vehicles and humans will most likely be developed and tested. The hub-to-hub model 
									represents a practical starting point for the deployment of autonomous delivery vehicles, the 
									opportunity of this model can also be economically feasible, especially for long-distance trips. 
									In addition, a concept of an automated vehicle designed to be placed on sidewalks will most 
									likely happen. These sidewalk vehicles are designed to travel at 4 to 6 km/hr., this chosen 
									speed is to ensure safety among pedestrians and allow teleoperators to take control in the 
									case of an emergency. The use of these sidewalk vehicles can be classified as personal devices 
									rather than a vehicle, thus easing the legality and challenges that may arise from classifying 
									them as a vehicle. These sidewalk vehicles are currently not fully autonomous, being deployed in 
									closed environments, however, with the development of their navigation, may see a more autonomous 
									future. <b> [4] </b> </p>

								<p> <b> What technological or other developments make this possible? </b> <br> 
									As stated beforehand, there are many different components of the necessities of an automated 
									vehicle, its automatic control, architecture, artificial intelligence, and computer vision 
									are all technologies that are integrated into them. The development of implementing data will 
									be a key focus in ensuring the future of automated delivery is guaranteed. With the human 
									driver being less critical in the journey, the implementation of data will be needed between 
									the various trucks, shippers, brokers, and governments to ensure efficient and safe operations. 
									The data collected could also unlock opportunities for consumers as well, a more optimized 
									transportation system could lead to more sophisticated route, load, and scheduling optimisations 
									as well as the ability to track shipments in real-time and location. <b> [5] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the likely impact? </b> <br> 
									Due to the economic and social impacts of COVID-19, the accelerated growth in eCommerce and 
									delivery services have grown exponentially within the last 2 years. The use of automated delivery 
									vehicles will be able to meet those demands as it is a much safer method of transporting goods. 
									In addition, the transition to automated driving will most likely have a direct economic impact, 
									specifically related to the investments made to provide autonomous delivery services. Furthermore, 
									the much wider economic impacts that are brought by autonomous delivery vehicles are improved 
									road safety, reduction of emissions and improved time to delivery. <b> [6] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is the potential impact of this development? </b> <br> 
									There are many potential impacts in different aspects. There are many potential environmental 
									impacts of the deployment of autonomous delivery vehicles, the reduction of vehicle collisions 
									will dramatically reduce as most crashes are caused by human error. In addition, there will be 
									improved mobility and access to fresh food for those unable or unwilling to drive, alongside 
									the reduced full consumption and environmental impact it will bring if fuel is consumed and 
									emitted <b> [7] </b> Furthermore, there will most likely have a direct economic impact. The wages paid 
									to direct employees of the autonomous vehicle industry as well as supplying industries will most 
									likely increase, alongside the impact on income and business tax payments. <b> [8] </b> </p> 

								<p> <b> What is likely to change? </b> <br> 
									The use of autonomous vehicles will most likely change the ways that transporting goods 
									and services is fulfilled. Without the need for humans, it will most likely reach a stage 
									where all delivery services will use some form of an autonomous vehicle. This stage would 
									be classified as “Level 5” <b> [9] </b> Individuals who have senior status, disabilities and are 
									unable to drive will most likely use autonomous vehicles to create their needs easier and 
									more accessible. </p> 

								<p> <b> Which people will be most affected and how? </b> <br> 
									Most likely everyone in every industry and society will be affected. In the retail and 
									services industry, the transportation of goods will be more efficient and quicker. 
									Furthermore, in the IT industry, the need for developers and leaders will increase as 
									more autonomous delivery vehicles roll out. In addition, individuals that are under the 
									circumstances of not having the ability to drive will also be affected, as the use of 
									autonomous delivery vehicles will be a quicker and more efficient option to be able to 
									have their necessities. </p> 

								<p> <b> Will this create, replace, or make redundant any jobs and technologies?	</b> <br> 
									The deployment of autonomous delivery vehicles is expected to have a disruptive effect on
									several industries and professions. This effect will depend greatly on the extent and speed
									in which this technology will be readily available, as well as the consumer practices at the
									time. However, it is guaranteed that autonomous delivery vehicles will both create jobs and 
									replace jobs. After the effort of long hours of trucking, the human driver will most likely be 
									fatigued. With the use of autonomous delivery vehicles, the elimination of breaks will 
									substantially improve the delivery time. <b> [10] </b> As the demand for autonomous vehicles will increase, 
									the creation of jobs in all aspects of the industry will as well. Developers, programmers, and 
									business workers will all have many openings in the future as the industry for autonomous delivery 
									vehicles grow. </p> 

								<p> <b> How will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									The use of autonomous delivery vehicles will change the ways I am able to receive and purchase 
									goods. The speed of delivery will be more convenient as the need for human drivers will reduce. 
									In addition, the potential of being able to track the shipment’s location and live tracking will 
									also be an improvement from having to see written updates. Furthermore, autonomous delivery 
									vehicles will also be a great alternative if I am under the circumstances of not being able to 
									drive. </p> 

								<p> <b> In your daily life, how will this affect you? </b> <br> 
									As an individual who regularly orders from food delivery and e-commerce, it will impact the 
									efficiency and be a much quicker method rather than having a human deliver it. It will also 
									be a potential career option as the demand for individuals with knowledge and skills in 
									programming and artificial intelligence will increase in the coming years of autonomous 
									delivery vehicles. </p> 
								
								<p> <b> What will be different for you?	</b> <br> 
									Personally, choosing the option to have an autonomous delivery vehicle will eliminate any 
									stress and complications that arise from having a human driver, alongside the fact that live 
									tracking and real-time location will be available from choosing this alternative method of 
									shipment. Furthermore, a career in autonomous vehicles will be a possibility that I will 
									consider, the factors that generally make autonomous vehicles beneficial for society and 
									the environment are driving factors for my choice. </p> 

								<p> <b> How might this affect members of your family and your friends? </b> <br> 
									As stated before, the use of autonomous delivery vehicles can also affect our loved ones. 
									If any of them are in the situation of being unable to drive for necessities, the alternative 
									of having any goods being able to be delivered in a safer and more efficient way proves that 
									autonomous vehicles are the future. Moreover, there will also be a possible career path as 
									openings relating to autonomous vehicles will most likely increase over the years of deployment. </p>

							<article id="ProjectIdea">
								<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
								<p> <b> Overview: </b> <br> 
									Group 12’s project idea is to publish a mobile application for IOS and Android mobile devices, 
									this application would be a reporting system for vehicular incidents by linking a dashcam to 
									the application to allow easy evidence collection and submission/reporting. The mobile 
									application would be linked to a dash camera in an automobile, this would allow the user 
									to get easy and fast access to the video captured from the dashcam, an example would be a 
									driver hitting a parked car, and then driving off trying to avoid the consequences. 
									From there the footage captured on the dashcam could be 
									downloaded via the application and be used as evidence against the 
									perpetrator. The application would feature a reporting system to 
									allow the user to send in that footage from the dashcam to the 
									relevant authorities. The application would also feature an emergency line to 
									services such as ambulances and the police.  This is in case of particularly bad collisions 
									caught by the app where those services may be required. This application would allow even those 
									with little technological experience to be able to use the application successfully and report 
									crimes. The outcome being, that with this new application, there will be less reckless drivers 
									as the thought of being recorded and reported will deter them from engaging in dangerous 
									driving. With the increasing road fatalities, 119 in the month of september 2022, the outcome 
									of this project idea is to create a safer road where drivers can feel less worried about being 
									involved in a potentially fatal accident. This idea was created as an offshoot of Austin Bowen’s 
									original idea for Assignment 1, after taking into account the feedback received from assessors 
									and staff. </p>

								<p> <b> Motivation: </b> <br> 
									One of the group's motivations for undertaking this project is to decrease the amount of road 
									fatalities and injuries sustained by the Australian population. According to the Bureau of 
									Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE), there were 119 road deaths for the 
									month of September in 2022 alone. This is a 28.8% increase than the average for the month of 
									September for the last five years. These figures come from the official BITRE publications page. 
									The increasing amount of road deaths throughout the years shows that the roads of Australia are 
									getting more and more dangerous to be on. Through the creation and implementation of our project 
									idea, our goal is to utilise the mobile app to create safer roads and decrease the number of 
									injuries and fatalities on our roads. Motor vehicles are inherently dangerous modes of 
									transportation, paired with negligent drivers producing dangerous and potentially harmful 
									situations where death and bodily harm are a distinctly real possibility.
									Cameras and police vehicles have a limited ability to gather evidence for the purpose of fining 
									and arresting. This mobile application will be user-friendly to allow even those with less 
									technical knowledge to be able to contribute to the reporting system. 
									With the use of our application, everyday individuals would be able to assist in that endeavour 
									by gathering evidence and submitting it to authorities through our app. 
									This is a form of deterrent, with more chance of being reported, the likelihood of offenders 
									reoffending will decrease. </p> 

								<p> <b> Description: </b> <br> <br> 

								<b> Licensing and Platform </b> <br> 
									Group 12’s project is a mobile application, this application will be available on iOS App 
									Store as well as Android’s Google Play store. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> iOS </i> </b> <br> 
									In order to publish this application on the iOS App Store, a payment of $155 AUD is necessary. 
									This is to create and register an Apple developer account, this developer account is required to 
									be able to publish applications onto the App Store and also give us the ability to test the apps 
									on the devices themselves, which will be a very useful and critical step in the creation process. 
									The recurring $155 payment is a yearly payment to allow our app to be published. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Android </i> </b> <br> 
									To allow the publishing of applications onto the Google Play store, a Google publishing account 
									is required, however, the registration fee for Android is far cheaper than Apple, and a one-time 
									payment of $25 will be required to enable the ability to publish. 
									The use of both of the publishing accounts will allow us to implement our service onto both 
									android and apple users, this will increase our consumer base and allow for more usage of our 
									app throughout the general population. Our application will be free to download and will not 
									require a subscription or any other sort of payment to use the application’s features. </p> 

								<p> <b> Features </b> <br> <br> 
									
								<b> <i> UI Interface </i> </b> <br> 
									Our application will utilise a blue colour scheme. This colour scheme links to the uses of the 
									application, as the police department in Australia also uses blue as its signature colour. This 
									will give a sense of connection between our app and the proper authorities. 
									We plan to focus our user interface on ease of access and concise presentation of information, 
									to do this we will have a sidebar with minimal text and opt to use graphical images to convey 
									what each option within the sidebar does. A graphic designer on the team makes this aspect of 
									the project a much more feasible idea and will allow a level of expertise and knowledge to be 
									brought into our application. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Sidebars </i> </b> <br> 
									Our user interface will consist of a sidebar with four main panels with different options 
									for the users to choose from. The sidebar will utilise roughly 20% of the space on the screen, 
									this is to allow sufficient space for the information to be viewed on after pressing on the 
									options on the sidebar. The sidebar will hold most of the colour of the screen as the other 
									portion will be white so it does not interfere with the text on the page the 
									users will be reading. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> First Sidebar - Report </i> </b> <br> 
									The first option on our sidebar will be a report symbol that will transfer the user to our 
									incident report page. This will be a submission format where the user can download and attach 
									the recording from their dashcam and upload it to the authorities. Users will have the option 
									of submitting this information anonymously or providing their information when filling out the 
									form, this is to protect the user's privacy in case they believe that they would be in danger 
									if they provided their information onto the document. The users will also have the option of 
									putting the address of the incident onto the report, this will be linked to a system where the 
									incident will appear on a GPS map, allowing other users to see where and what the incident that 
									occurred was. The video report will be sent to police services to be used as evidence against 
									the offender. Users will have the option of using a QR code or link directed to the video and 
									being able to share that video with others online, this will promote sharing and featuring 
									videos between communities and users. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Second Sidebar - Cloud Storage </i> </b> <br> 
									The second option on our sidebar will be a storage page where past recordings will be saved 
									and available for future viewing. This is to allow the user to watch back the footage they 
									have collected to make sure they do not send in footage that has no actual evidence of the 
									offence or is not relevant to what the reported crime is. The storage page will allow users 
									to delete their saved footage as well so they do not end up with large amounts of their storage 
									space on their device being used up by their downloaded dashcam videos. The video playback will 
									allow users to see the video at a slower playback speed, with the options ranging from 
									0.25x,0.5x,0.75x and 1x. This will give the user a better quality of life so that they do not 
									have to try and discern any details from the footage in real-time as they can slow it down to 
									be able to better view the evidence they have collected. <br> <br>  

								<b> <i> Third Sidebar - Hotline </i> </b> <br> 
									The third option for our sidebar will be a page with a hotline to emergency services, if the 
									incident recorded is so severe that emergency services must be contacted this will allow easy 
									access and quick response for calling. Numbers 000, 131 444 and 1800 333 000 will all be featured 
									on this screen with a small description of each number's use and purpose. 000 is used for 
									immediate emergencies where the police, ambulance or fire services are needed, 131 444 is 
									reserved for non-urgent police assistance and 1800 333 000 is used to report criminal 
									information to the police directly. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Fourth Sidebar - Audit Log </i> </b> <br> 
									The fourth option on our sidebar will be a log and report of previous recordings and submissions 
									made by the user. This is to allow the user to view their previous reports and to prevent them 
									from potentially submitting the same report twice. Doing so would cause issues for the police 
									if they continued to get the same report over and over again, by allowing the user to view 
									their previous reports we are hoping to mitigate this problem. Our application will also take 
									advantage of the widget system offered on iOS 14, by implementing a widget onto the Iphone’s 
									homepage of the emergency services tab of our application, we will decrease the wait time for 
									users between opening our app and getting the desired services. Our application will also include 
									cloud services for users to keep more of their recordings and reports, this will allow users to 
									have more videos and reports. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Cloud and Location services	</i> </b> <br> 
									By adding cloud services they will not feel the pressure of having too many videos taking up space 
									on their mobile device, so therefore they will be more inclined to continue to record and report 
									incidents without fear of using up all available storage. The road reporting system will utilise 
									the GPS system featured on iPhones and Androids to pinpoint the location of the incident report, 
									this will give an accurate location of where the incident has happened. Furthermore, the 
									information will be shared with other users of the app as a shared network of information 
									across users. Having users engage in a community feature like this is in the hopes that the 
									users will continue to build this network of information to communicate with each other and 
									create a more knowledgeable community that is aware of the dangerous incidents on the road, this 
									will facilitate the sharing of information in regards to dangerous incidents and individuals on 
									the road. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Connection </i> </b> <br> 
									Our application will utilise 4G,5G and WIFI to manage downloads and uploads of the videos and 
									reports. The plan is for this application to have an effect on the number of offenders there 
									are on the road. We hope to decrease them by introducing all these easier functions for the 
									users to make use of. This will have a positive effect on the safety of the roads throughout 
									Australia. Group 12’s aim is to create an application that will make the roads safer as well 
									as give consequences to members of society who believe they can escape the law and get away
									with it. </p> 

								<p> <b> Tools and Technology: </b> <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Technology </i> </b> <br> 
									Our application will be used on Apple and Android devices, this means as a collective we will have 
									to create Google developer accounts and Apple developer accounts. These accounts are vital to the 
									creation of our app and it cannot be completed without them. 
									These accounts feature registration fees, for the Apple developer account, a recurring fee of $155 
									every 12 months while Android developer accounts require a $25 one-time payment. The technology 
									necessary for the creation of this application includes a cloud service that users will use to 
									store their recorded videos and reports of the incidents captured by their dash cameras. Our 
									application will also need to use an application programming interface (API). This is to facilitate 
									the sending of videos between users and the police. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Programming Languages </i> </b> <br> 
									Java is a programming language we will be coding the application in, the original purpose of java 
									is to develop application software, therefore we believe it would be a good programming language 
									for our project. Apple has created a programming language called Swift for the purpose of 
									programming applications on their iOS devices. Swift is friendly to new programmers so as a 
									group with little experience in the programming world we believe it would be a good choice for 
									us to use that as a way to program our application. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Connection </i> </b> <br> 
									Our application will utilise the 4G and 5G networks as well as WIFI for the uploading and 
									downloading of videos recorded on the user's dashcam. 4G and 5G are essential as users will 
									not have access to wifi while they are out and about driving their vehicles. Allowing the 
									process to be done with 4G and 5G, will create less hassle for the user and increase the odds 
									of using our service more regularly. </p> 

								<p> <b> Skills: </b> <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Mobile Developers </i> </b> <br> 
									The skills our project would need to be successful, would be the skills that are used by Mobile 
									Developers. Such as basic knowledge of commonly used programming languages like HTML 5 
									and CSS, as well as being familiar with application programming interfaces for mobile 
									platforms, specifically iOS and android. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Full Stack Developers </i> </b> <br> 
									To create our project, we will need the skill and knowledge used by Full Stack Developers. 
									This knowledge involves front-end programming languages such as CSS and Java, as well as 
									back-end technologies such as C++. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Networking </i> </b> <br> 
									Our project will also rely on the skills of a networking developer, to maintain the data 
									network between our application and the users, as well as the data moved between our 
									network and the police database. Knowledge of multiple programming languages will be key in 
									creating and maintaining our application to a sufficient degree. <br> <br> 

								<b> <i> Legal </i> </b> <br> 
									The legality regarding the sending of personal information such as a video of another person's 
									licence plate to the police will be an issue our group will need to address in the creation of 
									this application. For this reason, knowledge of the laws and regulations surrounding the 
									sharing and sending of personal information is a must-have for the creation of our project. </p> 

								<p> <b> Outcome: </b> <br> 
									Group 12’s intentions with this project are to create a safer environment on the roads for 
									everyone through the use of an app connected to dashcams within vehicles. This would mean 
									a safer population and happier people on the roads alongside fewer negligent drivers and 
									dangerous offenders. The outcome of this project is to provide drivers with an easy-to-access 
									application, and a method of reporting traffic incidents and negligent drivers. An easier system 
									to report crimes would make people more inclined to use the application, as they would not need 
									an understanding of technology. This would draw in even those who do not have a lot of experience 
									with technology and struggle to use it. This application would have a butterfly effect, meaning 
									that there are fewer perpetrators on the roads. This means the adoption of our application 
									by the general public would have a positive effect on the country as a whole. Fewer perpetrators 
									on our roads would mean that they are safer to drive on and vehicular fatalities and injuries 
									would decrease in number. </p>
