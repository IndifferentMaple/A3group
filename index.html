								<h2 class="major">Project Overview</h2>

								<p> <h3> Topic </h3>  
									Group 12 aims to create a mobile application for our group project. The application will be available for iOS and Android devices. Our
									app will be used to report criminal incidents on the road by linking the application to a dashcam within a vehicle. The goal of our
									application is to create safer roads for the people of Australia to be able to drive on. The reporting system will allow everyday people to
									be able to send in evidence of crimes committed on the road. This will act as a deterrent for people willing to break the law, as they will
									have a higher chance of being caught committing these crimes if more people adopt our application. Our application will also make
									the life of police officers and other emergency workers easier, this is because as the number of potential criminals decreases, so does
									the likelihood that those emergency services will be contacted because of the criminal actions. Another goal of ours is to make the
									process of gathering evidence against offenders easier by giving everyday people easy access to do so through our app. By being able
									to deter criminals and expedite the process of detaining them we will in turn create safer roads through the use of our app. </p>
									
								<p> <h3> Motivation </h3> 
									We used Austin Bowen’s project idea as a basis to build off as we all agreed it was a very interesting choice. Safety and trying to ensure
									the safety of everyday people is one of the other reasons why we chose to pursue this project. By creating this reporting app and
									allowing it to be used on a wide scale it will in turn become a deterrent. This will discourage criminals from breaking the law as the
									chance of them being caught will increase. If we were to show this to a future employer, they would gain an understanding of our
									group’s morals and ethics as one of our main reasons for creating this project is to make the roads safer. Our application aims to be the
									most innovative tool relating to road safety and crime submission, there are no other competitors that are similar to us, so we plan to
									capitalise off this unused concept. </p> 

								<p> <h3> Landscape </h3> 
									There are other crime-related apps such as Citizen <b> [1] </b> which allow the user to report crimes going on in the area close to them and to
									be able to contact first responders. The app uses a GPS to show the crimes on a real-time map in location to the user and also warns
									users of any dangerous crimes in their area. However this is the closest available application that is remotely similar to our project. The
									features listed on the Citizen app is only a minor feature within our application. Our application is innovative since there is no other
									application that has the same general concept on the market. This is a key difference to the app. This application will try to take
									advantage of an untapped demographic who will use our application Dash Cam Now as it will be more convenient in their daily use. </p>

								<p> <h2> Aims </h2> 
									The aim of our project is to create a mobile application that can be used by everyday people. It will
									be a reporting application allowing the user to connect to their dashcam and send information
									straight to the police. </p>

								<p> <h4> Goal 1 </h4> 
									Our first goal would be to program the application and to get it to the level of a workable prototype.
									Doing this however would take considerable effort as none of the members of Group 12 has
									experience programming or designing mobile applications. To be able to get the application to a
									prototype level we would need experience in using apple and androids unique programming
									systems. This is a very important goal and one I think we should focus on to be the most efficient in
									the process of creating this application. </p> 

								<p> <h4> Goal 2 </h4> 
									The second goal of our project would be to get the application to link with dash cams within
									vehicles. This will be a very important step as it will allow us to use the application in a real setting
									and test out whether our idea will work as intended or if we may need to find an alternate solution
									to reach our original idea.	</p> 

								<p> <h4> Goal 3 </h4> 
									Our third and final goal of our project would be to create a successful marketing and advertisement
									concepts that we are all satisfied with. This will be an important concept to create if we decide to
									monetize our application which we will most likely do. </p>

								<p> <h2> Plans and Progress </h2> </p> 

								<p> <h3> Plans </h3> 
									Group 12’s project will be to develop and publish a mobile application for IOS and Android mobile devices. This application will be an application used as a reporting
									system for vehicular incidents and mishaps in which further proof and submission will be needed. A dashcam would be the main system to connect itself to the
									application, and various technologies and services will be used for this to be possible. This application will allow users the ability to immediately upload a video clip
									onto the application from their dashcams in real-time, wherever and whenever they choose. An example of this use would be an incident of a driver committing a
									hit-and-run offence, witnesses using this application would have the ability to clip the recent accident and submit it through the app. This clip could and will most
									likely be used as evidence by whoever chooses to use it, whether it be the defendant or law enforcement. <br> <br> 

									The main outcome our group hopes to achieve is to finalize and develop working prototypes of this application. These prototypes will be achieved using different
									forms of applications and will be displayed below in the progression subheading. Alongside a group effort, we hope to achieve individual efforts as well, gaining
									experience from research and using these tools to help develop our application to its potential.
									Additionally, this application will also have marketing/advertisement concepts. There will be two forms of marketing that will be created, these being – a preview of
									the application’s page in the IOS <b> [1] </b> and Android <b> [2] </b> application stores, alongside various forms of popup advertisements, specifically Facebook <b> [3] </b> and an email
									advertisement. <b> [4] </b> The concepts of these advertisements will hope to prove that the planning and development stage of our application have already fulfilled our
									aims and goals, alongside showing that this application has the ability to reach out to a wider audience. </p> 

								<p> <h3> Progress </h3> 
								<h4> Where It Began </h4> 
								This idea was first sparked by our team member Austin, he first thought of this idea when needing to create a project idea for his Assessment 1
								requirement. The first-ever drafts and features for this project were completely different to what is being developed currently. Austin’s idea was
								originally a scanner that would be attached or installed to motor vehicles that will detect various breaches of road rules, this scanner would
								automatically be recorded when drivers breach a road rule. This video would instantly be uploaded to State Transport, the defendant’s insurer,
								and to the authorities. </p>

								<p> <h4> Planning </h4>
								Our group’s original plan was to elaborate and expand on our team member Austin’s idea. At the time, Austin’s idea was a much more feasible
								project compared to all the other members who all had concepts that were much too complicated or would take too long to develop. We first
								started discussing how it would be possible to make this scanner functional, as the main features and overall vision were already developed by
								Austin beforehand. There was already a method of making this functional in Austin’s original plan, which was to have the scanner physically
								installed into the motor vehicle with a centralized computer inside the car as well, however, this method did not seem possible given the obvious
								factors that played into it. Our group researched many ways on how this would be possible, however, there was no avail. This project was at a
								standstill, so we all opted to go for a different route but still took the general concept and elements from Austin’s idea. <br> <br> 

								Our next plan was to use a modern dashcam, which was a much more affordable and feasible approach, and to create an API inside the
								dashcam which could take clips and upload them to a police database with a couple of interactions within the touchscreen. This idea seemed as
								a much more possible plan, as the use of APIs is not unfamiliar in this age of technology. Our group researched and discussed different methods
								that could help develop this plan, we contacted a platform engineer at Deloitte Digital <b> [1] </b> for assistance in helping this project to life by giving his
								input on our situation. After having many back-and-forth conversations with this IT professional, we were disappointed to learn that this idea
								would be an unrealistic approach for us, as having to research and use a physical item when each team member lived remotely would create
								challenges and conflicts. In the conversation with the IT Professional, they mentioned creating a mobile application instead, as it would be much
								easier to use an API to connect a dashcam and an application. <br> <br> 

								The idea of a mobile application lit the spark back into our development of the project, our group saw the many benefits that came with creating
								a mobile application, and it would be much more feasible given that there were many free resources that were available on the internet, also
								given the fact that application development is not limited to all members being present, but usually being done remotely. Our group researched
								and discussed how this application would work, alongside adding new features that would make this app not only limited to being a clip and
								submission concept. We finally decided that this approach was the best decision as it brought in many factors that each team member could
								contribute to. </p> 

								<p> <h4> Research </h4> 
								Each group member was tasked to research different aspects of our application. Our main vision was to create an
								application that had different functionalities to help assist drivers on the road, whether they were witnesses, victims, or
								perpetrators. <br> <br> 

								Our Team Lead Muhammad was tasked to research the general concept of the project and see how it compares to other
								competitors and concepts similar to it. Upon thorough research, Muhammad found that there were few to no other
								competitors that were similar to our concept, alongside discovering that there was an untapped demographic that would
								love to have this application in their lives. There were modern smartphone applications used by dashcams with many
								features, however, our group’s vision was much different to already existing applications. <br> <br> 

								Our Lead Design Christopher was tasked to research different UI schemes and designs that could be best suited for our application. After
								comparing with other applications and brainstorming different ideas, Christopher concluded that a blue colour scheme alongside a
								minimalistic design would be best suited for our application. The blue colour scheme would be inspired by the blue and white colour uniform
								that police typically wear throughout Australia, since our application would focus on submitting reports to police submission databases, it
								would be appropriate to use it. <br> <br> 

								Our Project Manager Jacob was tasked to research the different tools and technologies needed to develop this project. Jacob researched the
								different programs and tools modern mobile developers used to develop their applications, specifically for the front and back end of
								applications. Additionally, Jacob researched how cloud storage and computing would be used to store the videos uploaded by users without
								having to use physical hardware to achieve it. Finally, Jacob researched how WIFI, 4G and 5G networks have an impact on how much easier
								connecting a dashcam to a mobile application would work. <br> <br> 

								Our team member Jeremy was tasked to research the business and company side of the project. Jeremy researched the legality of such
								devices, comparing them with similar reporting applications such as Citizen. <b> [1] </b> Jeremy also researched the different ways that applications
								worked to project themselves to different demographics and concluded that being in the spotlight such as in news tabloids, advertisements
								and word of mouth could be effective. <br> <br> 

								Our team member Austin was tasked to research the different skills and requirements that were needed for this project. Austin researched
								the different types of roles and individuals that developed mobile applications, specifically mobile applications that involved networking,
								cloud, programming, and legality. Austin found that there were many different skills needed for this project, and concluded that experience
								in full-stack development, cloud computing, networking and law would be necessary. <br> <br> </p>

								<p> <h4> Drafts </h4> 
								After thorough investigative research, our group discussed and brainstormed the specific aspects that would create our application. Firstly,
								we discussed the design that would be best appropriate for this project, specifically the design of the user interface. Our group concluded
								that a panel with four buttons on the left or bottom of the phone screen would fit our minimalistic aim for this project. Next, our group
								decided what the different options in the panels would consist of. After brainstorming different options throughout the week, we came up
								with three buttons, these being – a report/submission tab used to submit video and audio clips to the authorities, a storage tab to store the
								different videos uploaded by the user, and finally a hotline of three emergency numbers used in Australia. <b> [1] </b> <br> <br>

								However, the last tab was not developed due to the group being stuck on deciding what should be used. After days of pondering what should
								take the final button, the idea of an audit log similar to Discords <b> [2] </b> should take up the last spot. Finally, the name of the application needed
								to be thought of. “DashCam Now!” was a snappy name that was inspired by the feedback from assessment two, it also reflects the quick
								and easy navigation throughout the application. Throughout the next few meetings, our group finalized the development of our application
								and made it apparent that a mobile application was the right decision. </p> 
									
								<p> <h2> Finalisation/Developments </h2> 
								<h3> Licensing and Platform: </h3>
								To publish this platform on the various different applications platforms, there will first have to be regulations and licensing that will need to be registered in order
								for this application to be published without no issues. </p>
								
								<p> <h3> Patenting: </h3> 
								App development is a fast-paced industry, meaning that there are many creators who will gain inspiration and inevitably end up having the same idea for an
								application. Our application is nothing that is previously heard of, as being able to upload a dashcam clip to report it in an instant is an innovation. For this
								reason, we will need to obtain a patent for our application to ensure our intellectual property is protected. <b> [1] </b> We will need to ensure to obtain a standard patent,
								this includes some of our technical aspects including the: <b> [2] </b> <br> <br> 

								- Server-based processing systems and methods. <br> 
								- User or mobile interface-based processing systems and methods. <br> 
								- Interaction between the user, mobile interface, and device with the server. <br> 
								- System for processing information partially at the mobile interface end and partially at the server end. <br> 
								- Method and system for generating output to a mobile device. <br> 
								- Creation of a database on the server or mobile device. <br> <br> 

								If obtaining a standard patent is successful, it can provide up to 20 years of protection. </p>

								<p> <h3> iOS: </h3> 
								In order to publish this application on the IOS App Store, there will be a few steps to achieve this. Firstly, an Apple Developer account will need to be created and
								registered. This developer account includes many benefits and resources, including support, distribution among other Apple properties and access to the
								developer and member-only events. This developer account will require a recurring annual payment of $99 USD or $155 AUD, <b> [2] </b> however, will allow access for
								our application to be published and gives the ability to test our application on their devices, which is a critical step in the creation process. </p>
									
								<p> <h3> Android: </h3> 
								To publish this application on the Google Play <b> [1] </b> store, there will be a similar process in order to achieve this. Firstly, a Google Play Developer account will need
								to be created and registered. This developer account will enable our group to access the Play Console, a dashboard that contains many different pages,
								categories and items that will be crucial in the release, a few examples of these are a testing feature, pre-launch report, monetization, and policy status. <b> [2] </b> This
								developer account will require a one-time payment of $25 USD or $37 AUD making this a more affordable option for Apple. This payment will enable the ability to
								publish. The purchase of both publishing accounts will allow us to push our application towards both Android and Apple users, increasing our consumer base
								and allowing for more usage of the application throughout the general population. This application will be free to download however will have an optional inapp purchase which will be discussed further. </p> 

								<p> <h3> Hosting: </h3> 
								This application will be primarily hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS provides an on-demand cloud computing platform and APIs on a pay-as-yougo basis. <b> [1] </b> There are many different services and tools that AWS provides which will be crucial in this development, however, it is more on the expensive side. 
								but there will be different methods in which we will be able to fund this matter which will be discussed further below. </p>
									
								<p> <h3> Cloud Services: </h3>
								This application will use the many cloud services that AWS provides, specifically its cloud storage. <b> [1] </b> This application will feature a storage tab, where users can
								view all the video clips that they have directly uploaded from their dashcam. Cloud storage will be a vital service to store users’ data and video clips without the
								need for physical hardware. Furthermore, the use of an API will be a great method for connecting our application to its server. AWS provides an API Gateway <b> [2] </b> 
								that only is paid whenever it is in use, with no minimum fees or commitments, it will be the most affordable and best choice considering how easily it will be
								available to use. </p>

								<p> <h3> Location Services: </h3> 
								The use of location services is not uncommon when it comes to mobile applications. This application will feature a road reporting system, similar to Waze, <b> [1] </b> 
								where users can report incidents on a map. This reporting system will utilize the GPS system featured on iPhone and Android devices to pinpoint the exact location
								of where incidents occur. This location service will be developed using the AWS Location Service <b> [2] </b> product, which securely and easily provides location data to
								applications, alongside many different request definitions and details. With having users engage in a community-like feature such as the road report system, the
								hopes of building a network of information to communicate with each other will help create a more knowledgeable community that encourages to help assist
								others on the road. </p>

								<p> <h3> Connection: </h3> 
								To enable the connection of Dash Cams to our application, there will be three different methods will be used. The utilization of 4G,
								5G as well WIFI <b> [1] </b> enables the user to stream and download videos directly to the application. The use of 4G and 5G are essential
								for users without access to WIFI, allowing the process to be used with 4G and 5G, which will create less hassle for the user and
								increase the rate of our application being used more regularly and remotely. </p>
								
								<p> <h3> User Interface: </h3> 
								This application will have a simplistic user interface. This user interface will focus on the ease of access and concise presentation of information. Our UI will
								utilize a blue colour scheme. This colour scheme will link to the blue colour scheme that police in Australia use on their uniforms and logo, <b> [1] </b> this will give
								a sense of connection between our app and the proper authorities. Minimal text and graphical images will be used throughout the navigation sidebar to
								keep the simplicity theme throughout the application. </p>

								<p> <h4> Navigation Panel </h4> 
								The user interface will consist of a navigation bar located at the bottom of the screen, each having four panels with different choices of actions. The
								sidebar will roughly take a maximum of 20% of space on the screen, to allow sufficient space for information to be viewed on the rest of the screen. The
								navigation bar will use the blue colour scheme, while the portion displaying the information will use white to not interfere with the text on the screen. </p>

								<p> <h4> First Bar – Report/Submission </h4> 
								The first choice on the navigation bar will display an exclamation mark symbol, which will direct the user to the incident report page. This report page will be
								in a submission format where a user will be able to attach a recording from their cloud storage and submit it to the authorities. Users will have the option to
								submit this information anonymously or provide information when filling out the necessary details, this is to protect the user’s identity in the case that the
								user believes that they would be in danger if they provide their details. Furthermore, users will also have the option to provide the address of the incident on
								the report, linking itself to the location service mentioned, it will allow other users to view where and what incident occurred. Users will have the option of
								generating a QR code or link to share the video with others online, this will help encourage sharing videos between communities and users when necessary. </p>

								<p> <h4> Second Bar – Cloud Storage </h4> 
								The second choice on the navigation bar will display a box symbol, which will direct the user to a page where they are able to view all their uploaded
								videos. The storage page allows the user to play back any footage they have collected to ensure that they do not submit any videos containing
								unnecessary evidence. The storage page will allow users to delete their saved footage, so they will not have large amounts of space being taken up on the
								cloud. A video playback feature will allow users to view their videos at a slower speed, with options ranging from 0.25x to 1x. This will give users a better
								focus on viewing any small details they may have missed. </p>

								<p> <h4> Third Bar – Hotline </h4> 
								The third choice on the navigation bar will display a telephone symbol, which will direct the user to a page where different phone numbers are displayed.
								The numbers displayed are emergency service numbers, where in the case of an incident that is important or severe, easy access to various emergency
								services will be available. The numbers, 000 <b> [1] </b> , 131 444 <b> [2] </b> and 1800 333 000 <b> [3] </b> will all be featured with a small description informing the user of the
								purpose of the number. 000 for immediate emergencies where police, fire or ambulance services are needed, 131 444 for non-urgent police assistance
								and 1800 333 000 for a direct report of criminal information. </p>

								<p> <h4> Fourth Bar – Audit Log	</h4> 
								The fourth and final choice on the navigation bar will display a book symbol, which will direct the user to a page where a log of actions and report of
								previous recordings and submissions will be available. Inspired by Discord’s audit log feature, <b> [1] </b> the purpose is to allow the user to view their previous
								reports to prevent the user from potentially submitting the same report twice. </p> 

								<p> <h3> iPhone Widgets: </h3>
								The application will also take advantage of the widget system offered on IOS 14. <b> [1] </b> When implementing a widget onto the device’s homepage, it will
								display the emergency services tab of our application. This will decrease the response time of having to load the app and choose the right navigation bar
								option. </p>

								<p> <h3> First Draft / Vision </h3>
								After developing the final touches of the application, our group started brainstorming different diagram mockups that could take the shape of what our
								application would look like. This mockup would be created in Microsoft Paint by our Team Lead, Muhammad. The possible design of the application would
								include a side panel on the left with sections for the different tabs that would be able to be used on the application, these being: <br> <br> 
							
								- An exclamation mark, to symbolize the main report feature of the app. <br> 
								- A box icon, to symbolize the storage of the video clips and previous submissions. <br> 
								- A triple zero or emergency icon, to symbolize the hotlines that were able to be dialled in the case of an emergency. <br>
								- A book or writing icon, to symbolize the logbook that recorded the actions on the application. <br> <br> 

								Alongside a panel on the left, the right side of the screen would take up more space on the phone. This space would be where all the information
								and main usage would be done. <br> <br>

								</p>

								<p> <h3> Prototype 1 – Proto.io </h3>
								After presenting the first mockup diagram, the privilege of creating the first working prototype was placed with our
								Lead Designer, Christopher. They were tasked to create the prototype over the following days and present the
								prototype in the next meeting using the website Proto.io <b> [1] </b> Upon presenting, the other team members were
								astonished by the progress and functionality that Christopher was able to achieve in a short timeframe. The
								prototype had major changes in the design and functionality, while also changing the panel of buttons from the left
								to the bottom of the screen. <br> <br>

								<p> <h3> Prototype 2 – Adobe XD </h3>
								After presenting the first prototype, our Lead Designer would be tasked to create a second one using a much more
								different and complex application, this being Adobe XD. <b> [1] </b> Adobe XD is a much better tool with more features
								and benefits and considering our Lead Design Christopher had a background in graphic design, it would be
								appropriate for them to start using Adobe XD from now on. <br> <br>

								<p> <h3> Advertisement Concepts – Photoshop </h3>
								The idea of an advertisement campaign was conceptualized by our Team Lead Muhammad after watching an old RMIT lecture. This advertisement
								campaign would consist of two forms of marketing, these being – a preview of the application’s page in the IOS application store, <b> [1] </b> alongside various
								forms of popup advertisements, specifically Facebook full-screen <b> [2] </b> pop-ups and an email advertisement. <b> [3] </b> These advertisements are designed and
								created using the application Photoshop <b> [4] </b> by our Team Lead Muhammad, as he already has prior experience using Photoshop and has a vision of the
								outcome. <br> <br>

								<p> <h3> Funding: </h3>
									Building mobile applications come at a cost, there are many different factors that come into play even when developing a simple
									mobile application. The more features, technology and services, the more expensive it becomes. There are many ways of funding
									projects, these include – crowdfunding, (Kickstarter, GoFundMe) Private investors and networking just to name a few. <b> [1] </b> <br> <br> 

									This mobile application will have a variety of different methods to fund its development. Firstly, one of the main sources of funding that
									we aim to receive is from investors. Investors come from different backgrounds, so finding the right person can be challenging, however,
									our group have found many different areas where investors could discover our product, thus having the possibility to fund it. <b> [2] </b> <br> <br> 

									<b> Social Media - </b> Social media is a great place for marketing and getting your startup out to different audiences. Only a few dollars on Facebook <b> [3] </b> can have
									the potential to reach thousands of individuals, and with many individuals in higher positions using social media as well, it will be a matter of time before
									somebody of interest steps forward. <br> <br> 

									<b> Events – </b> Visibility is one of the main reason businesses and fundraising is successful, getting noticed by the right individuals, whom you know and who
									knows you. Attending various events is a great method to achieve this. In Australia, there are many different events and conferences that hold different
									conventions for startups, and many investors and businesspeople attend to look for the next big opportunity. Attending one of these events could not only
									make yourself visible but also network with potential partners and people. <br> <br> 
										
									<b> Media Coverage – </b> 9News <b> [4] </b> is Australia’s most popular news broadcasting stations, reaching over 9.7 million Australians each month across its different
									broadcast and properties. Media is one of the most consumed pieces of information daily, and many different brands and startups have gained success over
									its media coverage. Usually, these media outlets can have viewers request news, and even the slightest piece of coverage could have the potential to reach
									millions of people. Shark Tank <b> [5] </b> is a popular show on which investors hear pitches from startups and owners who want funding from them. These reality
									shows often have applications to join, and with the possibility of joining one of these, you only not get a chance to get funding from investors, but also have
									the potential to reach millions of viewers. <br> <br> 

									<b> Crowdfunding – </b> Crowdfunding is “the practice of funding a project or venture by raising-by-raising money from a large number of people whom each
									contribute a relatively small amount, typically via the internet.” Many successful businesses such as Oculus VR <b> [6] </b> , Pop Socket <b> [7] </b> and MVMT <b> [8] </b> all started
									with crowdfunding via the internet. Our group believes that our project is innovative enough to gather a great crowdfunding campaign, as there are no other
									applications on the market like ours, and the assistance of crowdfunding, it could help give us the extra push and motivation.
									Furthermore, once this project is launched, we plan to use the profits created from this application to help assist with its funding,
									this will be elaborated in-depth further. <br> <br> 
										 
									Furthermore, once this project is launched, we plan to use the profits created from this application to help assist with its funding,
									this will be elaborated in-depth further. </p>
									
									<p> <h3> Profiting: </h3>
									Once this application is launched, we plan to display small advertisements on this application to generate profits. However, the advertisements will be
									much different from regular advertisements on different applications. The advertisements will be a small bar directly above the navigation panel,
									eliminating any instance of random pop-up ads and full-screen ads. This is to prevent any unfortunate circumstances of advertisements preventing the
									user from their needs in time. Moving further, there will be an annual paid subscription to remove any advertisements from the application, this subscription
									will be priced at $2.99 AUD. Small transactions like these benefits both parties and will be a great way to receive profits. Finally, users will have the option to
									pay for more storage for their videos, each gigabyte costing $5.00 AUD. This will enable the user with extended space for their video clips while also
									generating a profitable income alongside being able to fund the services used. </p>

									<p> <h3> Dead Ends and Issues: </h3>
									In this project’s development, many issues and blocks occurred. Our first vision was to create a simple application with simple but efficient features,
									however, our goals and ideas slowly expanded to create more complex features with different components. After realizing that the possibility of being able
									to develop multiple features with unique characteristics seemed not possible given the timeframe and resources needed, we ultimately decided to opt for a
									more minimalistic approach. By using this approach, we managed to develop key features that made the application more optimized for modern use and
									what was realistic given our resources. <br> <br> 
		
									After deciding to go for a simpler approach, we, unfortunately, hit a large roadblock that we had to take days to consider and think about. Our main idea was
									to create a side panel within the application’s UI with four different buttons which were the main features of our application. The first three features were all
									thought of and planned out around the same time as we already discussed previously on what we were planning to have these buttons for. These three
									features included the – report system, cloud storage for video clips and the emergency hotline. The last feature, however, took us days to think of none of
									our group members thought of an idea that was efficient enough to be used as the last feature until finally, the use of an audit log displaying every single
									action that happened within the application was added. This audit log feature was inspired by Discord’s Audit Log feature used by owners and moderators of
									different discord servers to keep records of actions from different administrators, to make sure no malicious wrongdoing or mishaps occurred. </p> 

									<p> <h3> Decisions and Changes: </h3>
									A major change that we decided upon was to change the focus of our original plan. As mentioned before, our team member Austin thought of this idea as
									more of physical hardware rather than the digital software it is today. Firstly, our original intentions were to expand on Austin’s idea, however, due to the
									many factors that made this not feasible, it immediately shifted to creating some form of an API or feature that was built inside a modern dashcam. After
									little luck in researching how this would be possible, we decided that the best choice was just to create an application that was inspired by the features that
									we thought of previously with our first two concepts. This decision was the correct choice to make, as it made the work and research much easier as it was a
									simple concept that answered all our previous aims. This decision also brought out the best in all of our team members, more members gave more inputs
									and ideas to the conversation alongside contributing more effort as beforehand there were few contributions and ideas that team members gave as the
									previous concepts were too difficult to research and develop. <br> <br> 

									As stated previously, a very impactful decision we made was to create a change in how complex and intricate this project was intended to become. New
									goals and ideas were added along the way, however, we realized that the feasibility of this in such a short time span was not possible, so we ultimately
									decided to develop an application that had a minimalistic design and function. <br> <br> 

									Additionally, another decision we made was the concept of marketing advertisements. Originally our main goal was to develop and finalize this project to
									the point where we were able to create a fully functional prototype that was simplistic and ticked all our boxes, alongside being a prototype that we were all
									satisfied with. The idea of a marketing campaign came along near the end of our planning, however, we all felt like this was a necessary measure to make
									this project fulfill it is potential. We thought of different ways that we could advertise the application, but similarly to our project, it should also be a simple
									and minimalistic approach and thus our concept/mockups were created. </p>

							<p> <h3> Group Processes </h3>
							In assignment 2, our group did very well in producing an assignment in very little time from being autoallocated in our group. All group members were satisfied with our result so we have ultimately decided that
							there will be no need for any role changes or major changes in Assignment 3. However, we plan to have
							members who did less in Assignment 2 do more work in Assignment 3. </p>

							<p> <h3> Tools </h3>
							<b> Jeremy - </b> Jeremy was tasked to do the Roles and Testing section. He achieved this by doing research
							On different roles in different industries and asking other members about their weaknesses and strengths, Alongside doing extensive research in application testing. Jeremy also gave inputs and ideas towards
							the video presentation. <br> <br> 

							<b> Muhammad - </b> Muhammad was tasked to do the Plans and Progress, Timeframe and Scope and Limits. He achieved this by pre-planning and doing extensive research on different topics and matters. Muhammad
							Was also tasked with doing the Tools and Technology and Skills and Jobs section after Austin was
							Unresponsive during the final two weeks of the assignment. Muhammad also created the final script and
							Edited the video presentation. <br> <br> 

							<b> Austin - </b> Austin was initially tasked to do the Tools and Technology and Skills and jobs, however did not
							end up contributing anything In the end, so it was handed over to Muhammad. <br> <br> 

							<b> Jacob - </b> Jacob was tasked to do the Overview, Aims and RIsks of the assignment. He achieved this by doing
							Research about the application and providing information to assist other members. Jacob also gave inputs
							And ideas towards the video presentation. <br> <br> 

							<b> Christopher - </b> Christopher was tasked to create the functioning prototypes, website and Group Processes and
							Communications section of the assignment. They achieved this by researching how to use these tools and
							Taking information from group members on the vision of the application. Christopher also created the draft
							Script and storyboard for the presentation. </p> 
							
							<p> <h3> Tools Used to Communicate: </h3> 
							We used a vast variety of tools for this assignment, firstly for researching we had to use Google
							specifically for the Sections for Aims, Plans and Progress, Tools and Technology and Skills and Jobs. To communicate we held meetings regularly on Microsoft Teams, and we used Outlook to send
							files over to each other. We used a shared Google Docs document to place our information as a working document
							Before transferring to a final PDF. <br> <br>

							<p> <h3> Roles </h3>
							<b> Muhammad - </b> IT Project Manager (Team Leader) <br> 
							<b> Jacob - </b> Business Analyst <br> 
							<b> Christopher - </b> Visual Designer <br> 
							<b> Austin - </b> Business Analyst <br> 
							<b> Jeremy - </b> Project Administrator <br> 

							<br> We have Muhammad as our team leader and IT Project Manager. This is due to the leadership and direction he
							has shown from the start of the project. <br> 

							<br> We have Jacob and Austin as our two Business Analysts writing our specifications for the project. This is because
							they both have an eye for detail which is important. <br> 
							
							<br> Christopher is our Visual Designer who is working closely with the rest of the team to design our website and
							prototype. This is due to Christopher’s flare for graphic design. <br> 
							
							<br> Jeremy is our Project Administrator assisting Jacob and Austin with writing content for our specifications. Jeremy
							also has an eye for detail. <br> 
							
							<br> No changes from week to week. </p> 

							<p> <h3> Scope and Limits </h3>
							This development of an application would focus on developing the general concept and key functions of the
							application while doing extensive research and knowledge of how this application will be developed. Our group
							will prioritize delivering the best functioning prototypes to present our proof of concept, alongside creating
							different forms of marketing that best appeal to modern society. <br> 

							<br> However, there will be many limits in this project mainly due to not having enough time and members to
							complete this in such a short time span. Another limit is the lack of knowledge and experience in using the
							different technologies used to create this application, our most realistic approach to this is to learn and gain
							experience in using the different technologies, it would not be expected for us to be able to deliver a working
							application in time. </p> 

							<p> <h3> Risks </h3>
							The risks associated with our application is that app development is a skill unknown by
							our team members, and as such our ability to produce the application will be stunted
							as we must learn the process of app creation before we can begin to work on our own
							app. Learning new software and getting an understanding of the fundamental aspects
							of app development will take time. If our chosen software cannot produce what we
							envision then it means even more time wasted and money spent. The legality of our
							application method of acquiring the data on criminals is also a risk we must further
							understand. </p>

							<p> <h3> Group Processes and Communications </h3>
							As communication is a crucial part of any group project, team members
							will make frequent use of email and Microsoft Teams to communicate,
							with MS Teams meetings taking place 2-3 times within a week's time. By
							notifying each other of our availability to meet via email, the group takes
							into account all team members' attendance. <br> 
							
							<br> Should a group member not respond to communications, the group will
							voice our concerns to the relevant course coordinator early. Delaying
							troubling matters such as this will only cause future problems, as were the
							project to hit its deadline before we resolve the issue, the course
							coordinator would probably bring it up with the team. It's better to deal with
							problems than to avoid them, especially when working with others. </p>

							<p> <h3> Testing </h3>
							In the early days of development, and since the team is still quite small, simplified application testing methodologies can be employed to speed up the initial time
							to market with a proof of concept/beta. <br> 

							<br> Once the application reaches commercial release after the initial beta testing and has reached a good number of real-world users, new features will be developed
							for the application. Since the development team will certainly expand for version 2 and beyond, the testing methods will need to be improved and a good project
							management system like Jira, could be justified for use. To ease that transition it pays to have a good plan for what the later testing will look like so that useful
							groundwork can be done in the early days. <br> <br>

							<b> Unit testing - </b> This will be steered mainly by software programmers' recommendations. Beginning with a basic wireframe for
							unit testing included with the code. This will require the selection of a suitable Unit Testing framework for the software
							development environment that is ultimately opted for. In later development, there can be a review on the unit testing to flesh it
							out more and expand on the unit tests with clarity in structure and that there are rich helpful comments in the code. <b> [1] </b> <br> <br> 

							<b> Integration testing </b> for the prototype benefits from the speed of Big Bang (all together) integration testing, making it easier for the
							small team to achieve in a timely manner. Later development with a larger team will need to involve a more comprehensive
							integration testing system, like the hybrid integration testing model, which allows for both bottom-up and top-down testing of
							the software layers and units. <b> [2] </b> <br> <br> 

							<b> System testing </b> can be done manually at the alpha development stage of the very first version. However, it's essential to take
							some time to properly develop test plans and record these in such a way that AWS Device Farm can be taken advantage of for
							thorough cross-platform testing. By the time the project reaches the next version, AWS Device Farm will be set up and running to
							perform automated testing, along with a step-by-step wiki on how to add new tests when new functionality is added. <b> [3] </b> <br> <br> 

							<b> Beta testing </b> recruits for the first version will be sourced via an active facebook page and promotions for helpers made by a clever
							marketing person who can drive the page and create a good social media presence. Promotions will target conscientious drivers
							with a good balance between those who are iOS users versus Android users. Their questions, bugs and feedback can be gleaned
							and managed via a mediated forum like Github Issues or a Discord channel. <b> [4] </b> <br> <br> </p>

								<h2 class="major">Group Reflection</h2>

								<p> <b> Muhammad - </b> I believe that this group project during the first couple of weeks went really smoothly and very well.
								We all worked very efficiently during the time we were all active during meetings. However, I believe that a major
								thing that could be improved is the communication between group members in the last two weeks. In the last two
								weeks, some members were unresponsive and we missed a couple of meetings which brings me to the thing that
								surprised me.
								A thing that surprised me was that we were all able to work really well together on this project, and all our ideas and
								inputs helped us develop this project much faster than we expected. I have learned that in groups, anything can
								happen to anyone even when you least expect it, so you should always be prepared for the worst. <br> <br>

								<b> Jacob - </b> What I believe went well was how much better and efficient we were compared to the last assignment. One
								thing I think could be improved was how many of our group members attended meetings. One thing that was
								surprising was how well Christopher was developing prototypes and Muhammad's advertisements.
								What I have learned about groups is that communication and prompt responses to questions and requests are very
								important. <br> <br> 
									
								<b> Christopher - </b> I thought that our group made use of the time we had to complete the assignment well, as we
								scheduled more meetings to discuss, plan and share ideas, as well as using the time we had to complete our parts
								of the work proficiently. Something that could have been improved upon was the communication between
								members in the event of their absence, as the group needs to be updated as soon as possible of change in events
								to make timely changes to task allocation. What I found surprising throughout the course of the assignment was
								the ideas and advice my team members gave, it really helped me personally as I was unsure where to go in the
								direction of my work. One thing I have learned about working in a group is the importance of a variety of
								perspectives. <br> <br> 

								<b> Austin - </b> Did not contribute. <br> <br> 

								<b> Jeremy - </b> On reflection, our group performed reasonably well. We had our ups and downs but we managed to make
								it to the end. It was well-orchestrated and we all put in a great effort. We work well together as a team. Sometimes
								life gets in the way of study and this is now an exception. It surprised me that by the time we got to hand in
								assessment 3 some team members were non-responsive and didn’t complete the agreed work. Sometimes things
								don’t happen as planned. We all tried our best, which is the most important thing. <br> <br> 

								<h3> Whole Group </h3> 

								In this assignment we believe that one of the things that went well was the planning and efficiency in developing this project.
								Our group worked with great cohesion and synergy to complete the tasks required with minimal issues. The main reason why this
								project was much better in terms of development was due to preplanning and the enjoyment of developing this application. All
								group members gave their input which made the development and working much easier and faster. <br> <br> 

								One of the things that we needed to improve the most was the responsiveness among group members during the final two
								weeks of working. During this time, a couple of meetings had to be rescheduled due to members missing and also members
								unable to attend. Alongside some group members being unresponsive to the work and contributing little to no effort.
								A thing that was surprising was the fact that some members were unresponsive during the final weeks of this assignment. This
								was surprising due to the fact that previously these members were very much active during the development, however, this put
								a small halt in the progression which led to other group members having to take over their tasks in order to complete this
								assignment. <br> <br> 

								One thing that we learned about groups is to expect the unexpected. During this project, there were some things that we did not
								expect as a group, mainly the unresponsiveness of some group members during the final stages of the project. These group
								members were prevalent during the last assignment and during the early and middle development of this project, however due
								to unforeseen circumstances they were not active. </p>
